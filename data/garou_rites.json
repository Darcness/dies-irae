        "description": "Glass Walkers and Bone Gnawers know that it's nearly impossible to get across town in a hurry, especially around the morning and evening rush hour - and in very large cities, those morning and evening rush hours edge closer together every week. Garou can do it in their lupine and near-lupine forms, but most of the time traveling across town as a gigantic wolf isn't a reasonable thing to do. This ritual allows a Garou to get the attention of the pattern spiders that nurse the ebb and flow of traffic patterns across a city's streets and highways. The rite asks them to nudge things here and there to provide the clearest possible path for the Garou's vehicle. Lights turn green just as the character hits them, or stay green just long enough for the character to sneak through - or, failing that, nearby cops are distracted as the Garou runs the red. Note that Appease the Traffic Gods can't perform miracles: if there's an accident at one of the main intersections in town, the best this rite can do is free up an alternate side route. The traffic gods may well simply manifest in the form of a convenient ambulance or fire engine for the characters' vehicle to slipstream through traffic, but Garou should be aware that this rite won't protect them if they violate the simple and obvious rules of the road. Appease the Traffic Gods will never, for instance, lure a character's vehicle to drive on the sidewalk. System: The Garou must enact this rite at a site within about a quarter-mile of the city's geographic center. The rite begins an hour before dawn; the character beseeches spirits of the sky, rain, and sun to cleanse the filth from the sky. At the culmination of the hour-long rite, the character spends one Gnosis and rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty of the local Gauntlet, which means that a careful spirit survey of the geographical center of the city may be worthwhile before performing Clear the Miasma). If the Garou achieves three or more successes, the smog in the sky precipitates as ordinary dirt into the morning dew. The local Gauntlet drops by 1 for the day, and the general attitude of nature-spirits in the city improves as they don't need to spend their time fighting pollution and Wyrm taint. This last effect reduces the difficulty of all Social rolls dealing with local Gaian spirits by 1 for the next day.",

        "description": "Most tribes attempt to track down all children born to their Kinfolk within one month of the children's birth to see if they \"share the blood.\" (Most commonly, this search involves the Gift: Scent of the True Form.) Those who are Garou are \"baptized\" in the light of their auspice moon, beside a ritual fire. Such a baptism most commonly involves mingling ashes with a few drops of Garou blood. The mixture is then touched to the child's ears, nose, eyelids and tongue. In the presence of a lesser tribal spirit known as a Kin-Fetch, the babe is then held up to the moonlight while the baptizing Garou howls Gaia's greeting to the newborn. The ritemaster then has the Kin-Fetch kiss the infant. The spirit's fiery kiss inscribes a spiritual brand upon the babe in the form of the newborn's tribal pictograph. This mark is not visible on the newborn's body; the only mark left is spiritual. It is impossible to remove this spiritual brand. Such a mark can be traced and recognized by all Garou (including the Black Spiral Dancers, who all too often track down cubs of other tribes and capture them in order to create more of their foul number). The participating Kin-Fetch spirit is assigned to watch over the young Garou as she grows to maturity, so that the tribe may always know the child's location and whether she is endangered. When the child is about to undergo the First Change and is ready for the Rite of Passage, the spirit alerts the tribe. Unfortunately, such minor spirits are notoriously weak-willed and easily distracted. All too often, a Kin-Fetch loses track of its charge or becomes lost itself, leaving the young cub on her own. Such \"lost cubs\" often become Lunatics or recluses, terrified of themselves and unable to understand their powerful primal urges. System: The ritemaster makes a Charisma + Rituals roll. Only one success is required, but additional successes improve the chance that the Kin-Fetch will keep track of the child. This rite must be performed at night under the moon in which the child was born. Although this rite is normally performed within a month of birth, the brand can be inscribed at any time before the cub reaches adolescence and undergoes her First Change. The brand fades out of existence after the cub's Rite of Passage.",

        "description": "This literally named rite is quite simple, but is absolutely crucial to the entire camp's understanding of modern Garou war tactics. The rite temporarily binds a number of Kinfolk into a pack, asking the pack totem to accept them. To perform this rite a length of surgical thread is passed through the knuckles of one hand of each pack member and prospective Kinfolk. Every Kinfolk must stand next to at least one Garou, which means at least a third of the expanded pack must be werewolves. In the gaps between each hand a steel charm in the shape of a glyph is hung from the surgical thread. The two ends of the thread are tied together to form a circle. Following this the ritemaster recites a prayer to the pack totem three times, speaking more incoherently each time. At the conclusion of the last prayer, each member jerks their hand away, causing the surgical thread to rip through their skin. The thread will remain embedded in the ritemaster's knuckles. She then wears the ring of thread like a necklace. From now, she is the lynchpin of the pack. If she dies, the effects of the rite vanish. System: The ritemaster rolls Charisma + Leadership, difficulty 6. All Kinfolk involved in the rite receive the blessing of the pack totem exactly as the Garou do and may take part in pack tactics with them. The Gift lasts for one scene per success on the initial roll.",

This rite's popularity is relatively new as such things go; in the ancient days, a male child was often simply left out to die of exposure.

In contrast stands the Wendigo's solemn rite, in which the ritemaster and all the fallen one's packmates stand on the highest peak available, tails to the wind, and howl out their pride and grief to speed their companion onward to her next life. The exact form the rite takes does not matter, only the acknowledgment itself. System: The ritemaster leads the release of the Garou's combined emotions into the spirit world. The Uktena say that such emotions have a real impact upon the Umbra and that they help ensure that the departed Garou retains ties to her mortal relatives.

The Red Talons often bite their own paws and scratch their blood into the earth, while the Uktena pass their most powerful fetish from one to another as each in turn adds her voice to the howl. However, the howl must always echo forth and the eternal circle must form. System: The rite must be performed at least once per month to keep the caern consecrated.

Before a hunt for a specific item of lore or magic (such as a lost fetish or tome), the Garou prays while holding an attuned object (usually a water snake skin or, for the fortunate, an uktena scale). If successful, the Uktena finds the search much easier. If the attuned focus is lost, a new one must be found and attuned in order for the rite to work; attuned foci are personal and cannot be transferred. Smart Garou usually give some token of their gratitude for particularly successful uses of this rite. System: Initial attunement of an ordinary focus requires the expenditure of a temporary Gnosis point; an uktena scale is already considered attuned to the owner. Before the search begins, the Garou prays to Great Uktena while holding the focus; the player makes a Wits + Rituals roll (difficulty 7, or 6 if the focus is an uktena scale). For every two successes, the player may add one die to any Enigmas, Investigation or Occult roll related to the search for the object in question. Alternately, in difficult cases the Storyteller may drop hints in the form of omens, waking visions or intuitive leaps to get the ball rolling. The object must be of lore or magical value. The bonus ends when the Garou diverts from the quest for any reason (including sleep or eating, not including fighting guards who bar the Garou's path to the goal).",

This rite is often assigned to cubs, who are subsequently given the task of maintaining the fetishes of the sept. This is usually also the only time cubs are allowed near the arsenal of the sept. System: The player rolls Wits + Rituals, difficulty 8. Good roleplaying and clever ideas for honoring the spirit (emphasis on honoring here) could warrant bonus decreases in difficulty level.

When tending to herds of mortals still mattered to the Black Furies, they taught their charges the ways of the Earth Mother; Rejuvenate the Soil is one of those secrets. The planter takes a pound of seeds from the choicest crop produced or gathered this year, and burns that mass in a bronze bowl while murmuring prayers to Gaia in her guise as Demeter. She must insure that no ashes or cinders leave the fire, lest the ritual lose its efficacy. When the fire is complete, the Fury mixes in a few drops of her own blood. Using a labrys, the Fury next carves a glyph of fertility - at least three feet across, and preferably larger - into the soil at the center of the area to be affected. She then smears or pours the blood-ash mixture into the glyph. An area radiating out from the glyph will regain some of its bounty over the winter. System: The player should roll Stamina + Survival, difficulty 6 (unless the area is a former blight, in which case it must be ritually cleansed and even then the difficulty is 7 the first year).

It is a surprisingly delicate and beautiful rite, unaffected by the anguish and bitter anger often expressed by this tribe. It celebrates the return of the flowers to the land. Summers in the North Country are short and intense, the days as gloriously long as the interminable nights of Alaskan winters. The vampires loathe this time of year, and the Wendigo celebrate their exodus as well as the flowers' return. During this lyrical and joyous rite, the ritemaster leads the way out onto one of the sweeping plains of their land. The others of the sept trail along behind her in no particular order, often pelting each other with any snow still on the ground or leaping in mock ambushes. Spirits run high and that is as it should be, for the energy encourages all life to burst forth in joy. As they walk, the ritemaster tells the tale of Tuacholka, a Wendigo ancestor who climbed the highest mountain in the world to see Gaia Herself when She was grieving so fiercely for the loss of the Croatan that even the earth, Her body, could no longer grow warm. Tuacholka told Gaia that the Wendigo and their brothers and sisters of the Uktena would never forget the Croatan, and that they would gladly take the weight of their Mother's pain if only She would return Her warmth to the world. Grateful for Her children's love and strength, Gaia returned the warmth to the lands, and Her tears turned to flowers of love. As the ritemaster speaks, she ceremoniously gathers enough flowers to form a wreath. Shedding a single tear each upon the delicate flowers in memory of the Croatan, she passes the wreath to her septmates to add their tears. When all have done so, the ritemaster tosses the wreath far out onto a river or the ocean so that it might carry their pain and love to the Croatan. The Garou then turn to the fields and flowers they love and commence a wild, romping salute to the beauty of life and Gaia's blessings.",

Affording the caern the spiritual fortification it will need to defend itself, this rite is not only dangerous to the ritemaster, but to the caern as a whole if not performed properly and to exact detail. Ideally, the master of this rite should be the same person that opened the caern in the first place. If this is impossible, the ritemaster must call out to the spirit of the werewolf who opened the caern and ask for strength and wisdom, offering up a gift of some sort or another in trade. Normally, a chalice containing a small amount of blood from each member of the caern's Garou inhabitants is a worthy sacrifice, although the carcass of a Wyrm-minion, collection of talens or a greater fetish may also suffice depending on the nature of the caern's spirit. After the sacrifice is made (if necessary), the ritemaster must walk from the heart of the caern to the westernmost border of the caern's bawn at sunset and back again while the moon of her auspice is in apogee. This walk is performed while reciting the litany of every werewolf who has died in the defense of the caern since its opening. When the ritemaster returns to the heart of the caern, she must call out to the caern's spirit, reaffirming her sept's dedication to the caern in her solicitation for strength. System: In order to initiate the abscission of a caern, a character engages in a resisted, extended roll of Perception + Rituals (Difficulty 7). The number of successes needed equals 10 minus the caern's level. The character is opposed by the mounting intensity of the forces of the Wyld that seek to manifest within the caern in an effort to create a Threshold. The dice pool of the would-be Threshold is the level of the caern. The difficulty of the would-be Threshold is the character's Gnosis score, while the number of successes needed by the Threshold equals the character's Willpower. The first one to garner the necessary successes wins. If the character wins the contest, the caern's spirit has heard her call and marshals its spiritual as well as physical forces and allies in defense of the caern. The results of this call to battle are left to Storyteller discretion. If the character loses the contest, however, the opposite effect occurs; the Wyld's forces rally to attack the caern's inhabitants, and the Abscess begins to manifest completely throughout the caern, assimilating, draining, and destroying all that seek to impede its progress.",

Although any encountered spirit is subject to binding, the Garou generally feel that spirits should be bound only when needed. They do not feel good about binding spirits for great lengths of time. This point does not go uncontested, however, particularly by the mystics of the Uktena tribe. Spirits trapped through this rite may be bound into temporary service or into objects to create talens (see Fetishes and Talens, pp. 240-241). No spirit allows itself to be bound unless it is friendly to the binding character's totem. Spirits can be bound into objects, places, and people, although the Garou generally don't perform the last feat unless the need is great. Failing this rite can be dangerous, for the spirit is very likely to become hostile and attempt to harm the mystic. System: A Garou can attempt this rite only in the presence of a spirit, and it is usually performed in the Umbra. When attempting to bind a spirit, a Garou must first spend a number of Gnosis points (minimum one). Each point of Gnosis spent reduces the spirit's Gnosis rating by one. The Garou's player must then roll Willpower (difficulty of the spirit's adjusted Gnosis). The number of successes indicates how long the spirit may be forced into service (one week per success). In the case of a talen, the spirit is bound until the object is used. See the Appendix for examples of spirits and a list of sample talens.",

But to truly impress, the boaster must back up his claims. This rite is more than formalized bragging, for it forces the Garou to \"put up or shut up.\" Before a battle or mission, the Garou boasts before all assembled that he will perform a particularly impressive feat (for example, \"I will kill three Black Spirals with only my claws,\" \"I will scale the electrified razorwire of the refinery\" or \"I will be first to reach the shield wall, there to wrest the enemy's standard from his dead hand.\"). The boast is performed in a ritual fashion, with a short recitation of lineage and a summary of glorious deeds performed to date. If he makes good on his boast, he magnifies the Glory of the act. If he fails, the resulting derision of his peers costs him Glory; boasting is only respected if you can back it up. This rite is most commonly used among the Fianna, Get of Fenris and Wendigo, but most tribes have some version of it. System: For every two successes on a Charisma + Rituals roll (difficulty varies according to the feat proposed, with more difficult and glorious feats lowering the difficulty; the number should probably range from 4 to 8), the boast earns a potential extra temporary Glory, up to the amount of Glory the feat would ordinarily garner. If the rite is performed properly and the Garou successfully achieves his goal, he gains the Glory bonus. If he fails and lives, he loses that amount. If he dies while carrying out his deed, there is neither loss nor gain of extra Renown. A single pack may boast of a deed, but only the pack leader can perform the rite. In this case, difficulty is increased by one, and the entire pack gains or loses the Glory award.",

System: The Garou must go to a wild place, even if it's a vacant lot overgrown with mimosa or ailanthus trees, and act in a feral, animalistic fashion for long enough to become sweaty and filthy. He may be in any form while doing this. The player rolls Primal-Urge + Expression, difficulty 6 in a wild place with animals and plants, 8 in a wild place without animals larger than rats, and 9 in a tame place such as a nicely kept lawn. The player may add one to his Rage for each success on the roll, for the remainder of the scene. The Storyteller may wish to award a bonus success to players who get sufficiently into the spirit of the rite to roleplay it with great fervor.",

The plants do not grow unusually quickly, but can grow in plastic, concrete or other unusual places, drawing nutrients from the source. Three Garou are needed to make this rite work. The ritemaster makes an indentation in the surface using a claw, and plants the seed of the plant into it. The three then hold hands in a triangle around it, kneeling, and request the spirit of the material that it nurture and care for the plant. If the spirit agrees, a small green shoot will appear immediately. System: The ritemaster rolls Wits + Rituals. The difficulty depends on the surface and area. An abandoned lot is 5, a typical city building is 7, an oil spill would be 9. Each success yields an acre of improved cropland for the next year.",

Some Fenrir use it to verify the identity of a hero's descendants before passing on an inheritance; others use it to identify the father of a metis cub if none is forthcoming. The ritemaster draws the blood of the subject with a silver knife and sings a long paean to the ancestor-spirits of his tribe and any others that might be watching over the subject. As he completes the song, the ancestor-spirits whisper the subject's heritage into his ears. System: The ritemaster rolls Wits + Rituals, difficulty 7, as normal. Success reveals the subject's true heritage for one generation back per success (for example, two successes would reveal the subject's heritage as far back as his grandparents). In addition, the ritemaster receives the answer to one specific question about the subject's heritage per success, e.g., \"What was this cub's paternal grandfather's profession?\" or \"Does the blood of any other tribe run in this cub's veins?\" The answer will be accurate, as long as the answer can be found within the number of generations revealed; if the ritemaster gained four successes, for example, he could not ask \"Is this child descended from Frode?\" but he could accurately tell if the child's great-great-grandfather claimed descent from Frode or not. The Rite of Heritage works just as well with humans or wolves (although wolves, lacking names, are harder to accurately identify), even non-Kin or magi. It does not, however, work on the undead or on fae.",

In some septs, this spiritual change is sufficient, while in others it might take until the child is born, and in the most conservative septs a Fury is considered a Maiden until she gives birth to a child who lives for one lunar year. Regardless of when the sept declares the Fury to be a Mother, when the time is right, this ritual is performed. Mother and child are separated, and the young mother is bound - this may be simply a symbolic binding, a rope lightly draped over her, or it may be shackles and chains. The mother breaks free of the bonds and comes to her child's side while the Mothers and Crones of the sept watch; when she reaches her child again, the older women of the tribe welcome her.

        "description": "To perform this rite, the werewolves in mourning for a dead Garou gather in solemnity. Occasionally, human Kinfolk are invited to join, if they were particularly close to the departed Garou, or of her bloodline. Everyone in attendance at the rite should bring with them an object or item: one that belonged to the deceased, was given to them by the deceased, or commemorates something about her life and deeds. Then, during the rite, each participant should step forward and display the item, relating its story. The objects are often collected into a medicine bundle, or stored in a ritually carved box or chest, although what is done with the items varies from tribe to tribe. The items and the sadness all should be sacrificed, regardless. The box can be burnt, sending the collected smoke of all the memories onto the wind, into the next world along with the spirit of the dead Garou; or the box can be buried for a period of time (usually a lunar year) until the pain of mourning has lessened, then unearthed to signify the continuance of life, before being destroyed. The place where the box is buried is considered sacred, like a caern, for the duration of its interment. System: The ritemaster indicates who is to tell their story, usually in order of rank, from lowest to highest. Enemies of the deceased Garou have been known to attend a Rite of Remembrance. Unlike a simple Gathering for the Departed, which sometimes can make a connection to the spirit world through the power of released emotion, this is a rite performed chiefly to aid in the grieving of the living, and does not influence the spirits of the dead or any other ancestor-spirits. At the Storyteller's discretion, this rite may improve the Renown of the dead Garou; a particularly good story may also give the teller a point of Wisdom Renown as well, especially if she is a Galliard.",

System: The Garou invoking this rite confines herself in a dark room or cave. She whispers her darkest secret and then utters an oath of silence. Raven-spirits, attracted by her secret, carry any sound she makes into the Umbra once she leaves her confinement. If the werewolf chooses to speak for any reason, the rite ends immediately. The Raven-spirits, disappointed that the Garou did not reveal any more secrets, return the sounds they carried. For several minutes, the Garou is surrounded by a cacophony she created earlier. This rite silences only those sounds the Garou would have made directly. If she were to throw a rock at a window, for instance, the whistle of the rock through the air would be silent, but the shattering glass would not.

Such talismans are most commonly mundane items, for spiritual items such as fetishes and talens remain with the werewolf in all forms automatically. A werewolf most often performs this rite during the phase of the moon under which he was born. Each auspice has its own peculiar ritual. System: The cost is one Gnosis point per object dedicated, and a character may never have more objects bound to himself than his Gnosis score. Certain large objects (Storyteller's discretion) are considered to be more than one for the purposes of cost. Similarly, the Storyteller may allow multiple objects to count as one object if they are sufficiently related (and not an abuse of the rite). The most common example is permitting a set of clothes to count as one object rather than one shirt, one pair of pants and so on. A generous Storyteller might allow a container's contents (at the time of dedication) to count as part of the container - if, again, the players aren't abusing the rite by doing so. The Storyteller and the player should decide what happens to the object when the character assumes certain forms. For example, when the character assumes Crinos form, her backpack's straps may simply grow to fit around her shoulders (although the pack still cannot hold more items than normal). When the character is in Hispo form, her knife may meld with her body. In such cases, the object will appear as a tattoo.

This rite, known in India as the Rite of Namah-te and in China as the Rite of GongXi, is meant to allow two tribe members to greet one another with proper respect. The rite is a traditional greeting that's been used for many centuries. Two Stargazers meeting for the first time place the flat of their palms against their chest and bow their heads at one another. They hold the bow for as long as necessary, and then each Garou takes a small smear of ash or soil and anoints the other's forehead with it. Finally, both Stargazers utter a prayer to Gaia. The meanings to this ritual meeting are many. It is a wish for extended friendship, but in it is also the unspoken wish to have both minds joined in service to both Gaia (the Emerald Mother) and the Jade Emperor. Both Garou are equal in the eyes of those two cosmic forces, even if they are not technically equal in rank. In this meeting, egos are set aside and the two are - however briefly - conjoined in the service of Gaia. System: A Stargazer may only enact this rite when meeting another Stargazer for the first time. If the two have met previously, the rite may be performed, but without any spiritual benefits. Each Stargazer bows his Head for a number of minutes equal to the other Stargazer's Rank. When the rite is completed, the player rolls Charisma + Rituals (difficulty 6). If 1-2 successes are rolled, the Stargazer gains a single die on any Social roll involving the encountered Garou. However, if 3 or more successes are rolled, the Stargazer also gains a Willpower point alongside the bonus die.",

Doing so is commonly called 'opening' a caern. Opening a caern should not be attempted lightly. Caerns do not give up their energies easily, and failure to harness such power properly can result in serious damage to the Garou. Each caem has its own requirements of the ritemaster. The ritemaster must prove herself worthy of the caern's energies. In order to open a caern of Enigmas, a Garou might walk a spiral path while calling out the Greek myth of Persephone. To open a caem of Rage, the Garou might transform into Crinos and chant the litany of his ancestors who have fallen to the Wyrm. The key is forging a connection to the particular spirit of the caem. System: To open a caern, a character engages in a resisted, extended success test of Wits + Rituals (difficulty 7). The number of successes needed equals the caern's level. The character must overcome the caern spirit to prove herself worthy. The caern spirit uses its caern level as a dice pool. Its difficulty equals the character's Gnosis, while the number of successes needed equals the character's Willpower. The first one to gamer the necessary number of successes wins. If the character wins the test, she can add the caern's rating to her dice pool when performing actions appropriate to that caern's focus.

While the Garou plays, other participating Garou (if any) pace around the ritemaster, howling and growling in counterpoint to the beat. When performed on a mundane item, this rite enlivens the object's spirit, causing it to awaken and appear in the Umbra. For example, if the rite is performed on a VW bus, any Garou stepping sideways could see the bus as a true part of the landscape. However, it would appear as a stationary object in the Penumbra unless someone on the physical plane began to drive it, in which case it would appear as a driverless vehicle to anyone on the Umbra. When performed on plants, this rite is known as sanctification. Plant-spirits are benevolent, and an awakened Plant-spirit will lend its power as though it were a talen (one use). Different plants grant different abilities when sanctified. For example, sanctified foxglove protects against faerie magic (adding two to the difficulty of any faerie spell). The ritemaster must play a musical instrument or sing a song (talent doesn't matter). The difficulty of the roll is the spirit's Rage. Failure means that the spirit remains dormant. The Storyteller must decide whether the spirit is hostile or friendly to its awakener. Awakening a spirit does not allow any control over it; that requires either a Rite of Binding or a Gift.",

Incarnations are important to the Stargazers - when one dies, it's believed that, while their spirit may linger for a time, the Emerald Mother returns them quickly to the world to do her work once again. The quandary is then, why aren't there the same number of Stargazers now as there were in the beginning? The problem is, new Garou aren't being born. The body is like a vessel, and while in the womb it sits, vacant of the ancestral incarnation. But the biology is already determined. While the ancestral spirit may \"become\" the new child, that new child is more than likely not a Stargazer werewolf. Hence, the incarnations are still being born, but into the bodies of kin, not Garou. To perform this rite, the ritemaster must be present at the death of the Stargazer whose soul he wishes to track. Once the Garou has departed, this rite must be performed within twelve hours, or it will provide no answers. The one performing the rite mixes some of the fallen Garou's blood in a bowl with equal parts milk. The liquid must be stirred by the ritemaster's own fingers or hands, and then a piece of cake or bread must be soaked thoroughly in the mixture. The ritemaster eats the bread or cake, and when next he sleeps, he will be granted a vision of the newborn meant to house the next incarnation of the dead Stargazer. System: The Stargazer must enact the rite as described above, with all conditions present. The player rolls Perception + Rituals, and the difficulty of the roll is the departed Garou's permanent Rage score. The greater the successes, the longer the vision. This allows the ritemaster to more clearly see details of the identity (or other pertinent information) regarding the child.",

Unlike the Gathering for the Departed or Rite of Lasting Glory, which takes place once and soon after death, the Rite of Mourning can take place many times (often annually). There should be no more than ten participants at this rite, and only those closest to the memory of the departed partake in this intimate ceremony; loved ones, offspring, packmates and the closest of allies. The execution of the rite varies greatly from situation to situation and from tribe to tribe, but the most common version is moderately complex. The ritemaster calls the participants to him, and declares the name and deeds of the one to be honored. This can take the form of a long mournful cry, or a barely audible groan. This is followed by a small period of silent contemplation by everyone involved as they meditate upon what is lost. Then one by one the participants approach the site of worship (a dedicated shrine, a grave marker or something else representing the deceased) to offer a small token or gift of remembrance. The token may be a physical object like a weapon or fetish, or a symbolic offering like a teardrop or a smear of one's own blood. Upon the offering each one offers a remark on why they honor the deceased (whether for a personal reason, or for some quality or virtue they believe the deceased embodied in their life). As the mourners settle in front of the site of worship the ritemaster leads them in a sharing of tales of the deceased, where everyone shares their fond memories. This is often followed by a chant or song led by the ritemaster, but performed by all, calling on the deceased to watch over them and lend them his strength and virtue in their continuous struggle. As the song concludes the deceased may sometimes appear for a small delicate period of time to be with those closest to him again in his life. (It is not unheard of for those so honored to become ancestor-spirits due to the love and respect offered them during this ritual. After the spirit dissipates, if it shows at all, the participants give a farewell howl before breaking company or partaking in some revelry or another. System: The ritemaster must succeed on a Charisma + Rituals roll, difficulty 8 minus the rank of the honored Garou, with additional minus 1 for every five participants. On a marginal success (one success) the honored receives one posthumous point of Honor. On a moderate success (two successes), the honoree receives an amount of posthumous Renown equal to the number of participants, to be distributed among the categories the deceased is being remembered for. The participants all receive one point of Honor. On a complete success (three successes), the deceased receives Renown equal to the total ranks of all participants divided by two. The participants all receive an Honor reward equal to the rank of the deceased. With four or five successes the deceased has a chance of appearing as an apparition to comfort the participants; if this happens, the participants all have their Willpower replenished. If six or more successes are achieved the spirit is sure to appear unless somehow restrained, and the Storyteller should consider rewarding the participants with an extra point in the Ancestors Background, representing the ancestor-spirit of the deceased. Although the rite can be performed more than once for any given hero, all rites of mourning after the first have no game effect, Renown gains or otherwise.",

        "description": "At first glance, this rite appears almost generic. A week of feasting and cleansing isn't unique to the Glass Walkers. But look at when we hold it, and the reason behind the rite becomes clearer. The Promethean Daze happens right at the end of the year, along with human celebrations like Christmas, Kwanzaa, Chanukah, and, of course, the New Year. We're often called the \"tribe of Man\" and this rite certainly gives some weight to the moniker. This rite breaks down into two parts. The first part is marked by gluttony, and as a result tends to take up most of the week. We eat, drink, fight and make love (to Kinfolk, in theory) to our hearts' content. During that time, we supposedly work to throw off our limitations. It all happens through conversations, old grudges break down over wine and dinnertime conversations find an informality that lets us find simpler ways of operating. But as our Elizabeth proved, it can also happen in grander ways. Thanks to GWnet and video conferencing, this rite is becoming more global every year, and thus it can make a great platform for political moves. Elizabeth sighs: If there had been a better way to get the word out, I swear I'd have used it. I just hope I haven't doomed us to endless shock announcements every Daze. The second part begins when everyone is too full to eat anymore and too hung over to party. In this, we try to foresee the oncoming year. It happens in various ways. Theurges call on spirits for guidance, while others try to use clever deduction to make logical predictions. We all try to see concrete ways in which the tribe could further its spiritual, Garou, and human ties. In so doing, we renew ourselves. This aspect of the rite refers to the second portion of the week. (All that is necessary to ensure the success of the first portion is good food, wine and company.) The ritemaster supervises the assembled Garou in their predictions and closes the week with a toast to the sept's good fortune for the oncoming year. Afterwards, everyone gathered bows their head in a moment's silence. Sometimes this aspect of the rite is performed after other seasonal rites, but delaying the rite is rare. System: The ritemaster rolls Wits + Rituals, difficulty 7. If a simple success is achieved, all participating Garou recover all Willpower to face the new year. If three successes are gained, one Garou also has a vision of a minor event in the oncoming year. If five are gained, several Garou might have minor visions, or one may have a vision of a very major event indeed. This is left to Storyteller discretion.",

Affording the caern the spiritual fortification it will need to defend itself, this rite is not only dangerous to the ritemaster, but to the caern as a whole if not performed properly and to exact detail. Ideally, the master of this rite should be the same person that opened the caern in the first place. If this is impossible, the ritemaster must call out to the spirit of the werewolf who opened the caern and ask for strength and wisdom, offering up a gift of some sort or another in trade. Normally a chalice containing a small amount of blood from each member of the caern's Garou inhabitants is a worthy sacrifice, although the carcass of a Wyrm-minion, collection of talens or a greater fetish may also suffice depending on the nature of the caern's spirit. After the sacrifice is made (if necessary), the ritemaster must walk from the heart of the caern to the westernmost border of the caern's bawn at sunset and back again while the moon of her auspice is in apogee. This walk is performed while reciting the litany of every werewolf who has died in the defense of the caern since its opening. When the ritemaster returns to the heart of the caern, she must call out to the caern's spirit, re-affirming her sept's dedication to the caern in her solicitation for strength. System: In order to initiate the abscission of a caern, a character engages in a resisted, extended roll of Perception + Rituals (Difficulty 7). The number of successes needed equals 10 minus the caern's level. The character is opposed by the mounting intensity of the forces of the Wyld that seek to manifest within the caern in an effort to create a Threshold. The dice pool of the would-be Threshold is the level of the caern. The difficulty of the would-be Threshold is the character's Gnosis score, while the number of successes needed by the Threshold equals the character's Willpower. The first one to garner the necessary successes wins. If the character wins the contest, the caern's spirit has heard her call and marshals its spiritual as well as physical forces and allies in defense of the caern. The results of this call to battle are left to Storyteller discretion. If the character loses the contest, however, the opposite effect occurs; the Wyld's forces rally to attack the caern's inhabitants and the Abscess begins to manifest completely throughout the caern; assimilating, draining and destroying all that seek to impede its progress.",

Most Garou packs form when several young werewolves undergo their Rite of Passage at or around the same time, then set out to claim a totem and a place in Garou society. That doesn't always work though. Sometimes a pack suffers losses in battle and needs to reinforce, and other times First Changes come along so rarely that it might take years for enough Garou to form a new pack to come along. Long-established and famous packs have to deal with a constant trickle of cliath petitioning to join, and certain septs - especially those dominated by the Silver Fangs - expect true-bred children of powerful Garou to succeed their parents in their packs. On a practical, out-of-game level, sometimes you want to add a new player to your gaming group and bring her character into the pack. | The Rite of the Totem can induct a new member into a pack as readily as it creates a whole new pack, however the requirements and the procedure are slightly different. First and foremost, the prospect must have at least one dot of the Totem Background and must not currently have a totem (whether pack or personal). Second, the prospect must spend an entire lunar month, from auspice moon to auspice moon, living and fighting alongside her new pack and adhering to the prospective totem's ban. Any violation requires her to start the process over again on her next Auspice moon. Once the prospect meets all of those requirements, the ritemaster (who need not be a member of the pack being joined, but at least one member of the pack must be present and participate) performs the Rite of the Totem as described on p. 213 of W20. Instead of a spirit hunt for a member of the totem's brood, however, the pack's totem avatar presents a challenge directly to the prospect: a hunt, a fight, a riddle contest, or something else appropriate to the spirit. If the prospect successfully completes the challenge, the totem accepts her and she joins the pack. The players can spend the character's points in the Totem Background immediately to upgrade the totem's abilities. Moreover, as adding a new pack member is a momentous event, the other players may spend experience on more Totem Background dots if they are so inclined. Unlike when a pack performs the Rite of the Totem to gain a new totem, prospects must possess at least one dot of Totem; it takes more to bond with the spirit of an established pack than it does to bond with a new spirit.",

        "description": "Warpath Camp Rite. The Warpath have preserved this method of hunting seals and put it to a unique use. The idlak, a tool used by arctic Kinfolk for many years, is created out of a delicate feather tired to a long thin sliver of wood or bone. A hunter sticks this tool into a breathing hole in the ice; when a seal swims to the hold and surfaces for breath, it makes the idlak flutter and tremble. Similarly, this rite allows a Wendigo to pierce the Gauntlet with a fetish idlak, capturing a friendly spirit of Gaffling inside its slender form. This sets an alarm that makes it unnecessary for a Garou to peek through to the Umbra and thereby leave her Earthly back defenseless. Any Bane, or any other dangerous spirits that belong to the Weaver or the Wyrm, may draw near the idlak's place in the Penumbra without noticing it. If the vile spirits pass too closely, or cross the Gauntlet by Materializing, the Gaffling sends a warning by setting the idlak in motion, both physically and spiritually. When it is triggered, it enables the Garou who planted it to track the spirit's manifestation, or helps her to cross quickly into the Penumbra to follow the spirit's tracks and to engage in battle with it. | The player spends at least two points of Gnosis when planting the idlak, and then rolls Gnosis + Perception. The number of successes the player rolls, or the number of additional Gnosis points spent, determines any additional Gnosis levels for the Gaffling. The spirit senses any thinning or puncture made in the Gauntlet, or the approach of any Bane or hostile spirit nearby in the Penumbra, and makes the idlak shake visibly in the Realm. It also calls mentally to the Garou who bound it into the idlak, alerting her that danger is near.",

Totems want their packs to be content in their place and free to serve Gaia in the best way possible, and all but the most prideful would rather release a pack from service than watch resentment fester. Similarly, if a pack willingly disbands for any reason, their totem bond dissipates. While this parting of the ways may be ringed with sadness or bitterness, it is usually amicable. The same totem might be willing to 're-adopt' the pack later if circumstances change and the pack shows a renewed willingness to follow the totem's edicts. If both the pack and the totem are willing, the totem bond may dissolve simply by declaring it so. The totem withdraws its avatar and the pack immediately loses all benefits of the totem.

Done deliberately and with ritual intent, this sends a clear message to the totem that its patronage is no longer welcome. This is a drastic step, unlikely to be taken well by the totem or by the Garou Nation at large; it's the mystical equivalent of announcing a breakup with your long-term partner by changing the locks and burning all their possessions on the lawn. The pack's original totem will almost certainly never take them back, and even other totems would require a great deal of convincing. | Burning bridges requires the pack ritualistically break the totem's Ban. This isn't a full on rite, just an action suffused with mystical intent that makes it clear that it wasn't just an accident. Followers of Cockroach might fumigate their homes and stay inside the tent, trusting their regeneration to keep them safe from the pesticides, while Raven's children might knock over a bank and sew their ill-gotten gains into the linings of their coats. The totem bond dissolves and the pack immediately loses all benefits of the totem. The totem avatar might very well attack its former packmates, or it might flee to bring news of the blasphemy to the rest of its brood. Finally, every member of the pack who participated loses 5 Honor and 5 Wisdom. The sole exception to this case is if the Wyrm has corrupted the totem, in which case the participants gain 3 Honor (but still lose Wisdom).

The Warrior (there can be more than one) attacks the Zmei to distract it while the rite is being performed. The Defender (again, there can be more than one) defends any attacks against the Ritemaster so her concentration is not broken; the Ritemaster must put total faith for her safety into the Defender's hands. Finally, the Ritemaster (there can be only one) performs the rite. She must make an extended roll of Wits + Occult against a difficulty of 7. She needs 23 successes. One roll can be made every turn if the Ritemaster is undisturbed. A botch at anytime means the rite must be started all over again (often fatal, considering the enemy). If the Ritemaster is wounded at anytime, the rite can still continue, but the Dice Pool is lowered as per the Health chart. During the rite, the Zmei, who knows very well what's going on, will try to take out the Ritemaster, devoting all its actions towards getting to her. This is why the Warriors and Defenders must be willing to give up their lives to protect her. One thing which would aid greatly in this task is the blood of heroes: a Silver Fang with a high Past Life. If one of the characters fits this description, the Storyteller may allow her to channel an ancestor who put the Zmei down long ago. The Storyteller should only allow the roll when in sight of the Zmei, and then the difficulty is 9. The Storyteller must decide which role the ancestor played: Warrior, Defender or Ritemaster. Each success will allow the character one extra die for various actions against the Zmei: Warrior: add dice to Brawl, Melee or damage (you know a weakness in the Zmei's scales). Defender: add dice to Stamina or Initiative (you can anticipate its actions and act first). Ritemaster: add dice to Occult. These extra dice can increase a character's Attributes or Abilities past their normal maximums. If the rite is successful, the Zmei will howl a scream of rage and frustration, only to be cut off in mid-howl as it sinks deep into the earth, frozen in a magical slumber. Nothing (short of a nuclear blast) can release it; even Baba Yaga's magic cannot undo the rite until 'ten generations have passed from the earth' (at least 500 years).

Typically, every Garou present donates 1 point of Gnosis, and the ritemaster spends 1 point permanently. Gathering more than 10 Gnosis makes the procedure easier.

It's much harder to overthrow a Zmei, for instance, than it is to convince elder and spirit alike that the tale of a Zmei's defeat is worthy of being remembered in the Record. Even so, it's not that easy to add to the Silver Record; otherwise, the Record would be much bigger than it actually is. By tradition, the Garou never kept the Silver Record in only one place at one time. Great Galliards, the Keepers of the Record, maintained the history in secret sacred places, rarer than caerns-the Lodges of the Silver Record. There they maintained it in its fullness, passing their duty on from one generation to the next, teaching its lessons to those who came seeking wisdom. Now, in the End Times, there are few of the sacred lodges remaining; depending on the Storyteller's whim, there might be as many as ten in all the world, or as few as one. To actually add something to the Record has always required a rite, a powerful rite granted only to the most worthy. This rite, the Song of Ages, is one of the badges of office of the Keepers of the Record. It's almost impossible to find a ritemaster who knows this rite at any sept; only a few remain. For this and other reasons, the rite is traditionally performed only at consolations, where representatives from many tribes can hear the tale and speak for or against its veracity. However, the final decision of whether the tale merits inclusion or not belongs to the Keeper in attendance. Sometimes the Keeper himself hears the tale for the first time at the moot, as another Galliard bears the story to her nation. If the Keeper has heard the story beforehand and deemed it worthy, he may sing the tale to the assembled Garou even as he performs the rite, that they may hear it for the first time as it enters into the Record forever. This rite, available only to Keepers of the Silver Record (who themselves must be Galliards of Athro rank or greater) or their students, spiritually empowers a tale, binding it to the greater body of the Silver Record. The ritemaster sings or chants the tale as he claws the story in pictogram form into a sanctified surface, preferably with as many onlookers and listeners as possible. When the tale is ended, the ritemaster bows to the four directions, then leads the assembled Garou in a mighty howl of acknowledgement.",

This rite is most appropriate when the message that needs to be disseminated is important but not urgent - 'Be aware that the Chief of Police is in league with a Wyrm-cult' might work, while 'We're under attack by Black Spiral Dancers' is not a good choice for this rite. The Garou picks out a message of 100 words or fewer and uses Read All About It to insert that message into a local newspaper, concealing it such that only Garou can read it. The message might be placed anywhere in the paper that a short blurb might appear - the sidebar along the front page, short local news items, or the classified ads. Anyone subject to the Delirium simply will not see the message, instead glossing over it as an uninteresting news item. Garou can easily identify such messages as being special, however, and their eyes are drawn to them, making it quite likely that any werewolf who reads the paper will realize that it contains a special message for Garou only. Unfortunately, the Glass Walker who developed this rite didn't consider that Black Spiral Dancers, being Garou, could also see the messages; however, other creatures in the thrall of the Wyrm cannot see it. It is rumored that the Glass Walkers have developed a similar ritual for use over the Internet, concealing important information in otherwise nonsensical spam email, Usenet, or message-board posts. System: To perform the rite, the ritemaster must write the message out by hand, in block printing, on newsprint. He uses a ball of toy putty to pull the message text off of the paper, and imprint it onto the most recent edition of the newspaper that he wishes to send the message through. He must spend one Willpower and achieve at least one success in a Willpower roll. Since the concealment of this message depends in part on the Delirium, Kinfolk who succeed at a Perception + Occult roll (difficulty 8) can also read it. (Creatures immune to the Delirium who are not Kinfolk, such as mages or vampires, cannot read the message; even undead who were Kin in life are unable to detect the hidden communication.) The message will appear in the next edition of the paper; its placement depends on the number of successes rolled. One success places the message deep in the classified ads, two in an interior section, three on the front page of an interior section, four successes puts the message on the front page but under the fold, and five successes puts the message on the front page, above the fold. A botch on this roll puts the message in the paper in such a manner that it is visible to everyone who reads it.",

The most common version of this rite requires that the Garou must make a braid from three of her hairs, three pieces of fine copper wire and three tendrils of ivy or other vine. Lengths of silk thread are sometimes substituted for the hair or wire. When the braid has been constructed, the Garou ties it around his own wrist and howls three words of power. The Uktena often drink a bitter potion that loosens the Garou's spirit from the Tellurian, while the Black Furies always perform this ritual in threesomes, never traveling the Deep Umbra alone. System: If the braid is destroyed while the Garou is in the Deep Umbra, the Garou takes one health level of aggravated damage and risks becoming lost forever if she does not return to the Near Umbra immediately.",

The rod must be the length of her own forearm, from tip of the elbow to tip of the longest claw. Into the rod, the ritemaster must carve a message of punishment, detailing either with symbols or words the transgressions of the Garou to be punished. Three eagle feathers are sometimes tied to the end of the rod, using a strip of leather or sinew. The ritemaster may keep this rod, or award it to someone who has been wronged by the werewolf in question. To complete the rite, she only needs to tap the target Garou on the shoulder or head with the rod. The taking of this coup triggers deep submission and remorse in the punished Garou, lessening their Renown, an effect that is not relieved until the next new moon. System: The ritemaster must make the standard Charisma + Rituals rolls at a difficulty of 7. The act of counting coup must take place in public. If the punished Garou is guilty, the amount of Honor Renown she loses increases by one point for every 5 witnesses. Similarly, the amount of Honor Renown awarded to the coup-giver and/or the ritemaster increases by one point for every 5 witnesses. However, if the Garou is not guilty of the deeds that have been inscribed onto the wand, it breaks when she takes the coup, and the ritemaster and the wielder of the wand suffer a loss of 1 point of Honor Renown and 1 point of Wisdom Renown.",

The Talons believe in facing their difficulties realistically, and it is considered proper to allow the ritemaster to finish before the next phase of the rite begins.

The Dying Cubs cannot say where they learned this rite; every sept that knows it seems to have learned it from a visiting Talon, but no one can trace the rite back to its origin. The ritemaster and any other Garou that participate bind and torture the victim for as long as they wish. The longer the victim remains alive and in pain, the more potent the rite. The Garou may use any means of inflicting pain they wish, and may even heal the victim to prolong his agony provided the victim always suffers from one health level of damage (if the victim is ever fully healed, the rite fails). When the victim can bear no more and finally expires, the ritemaster spills the victim's blood on the ground to replenish the land. Wyrm-taint is burned away and even the touch of the Weaver weakens somewhat. System: Any characters involved in this rite lose one point of temporary Honor for torturing a helpless victim (the Dying Cubs usually don't care). Any player whose character participates in the torture of the victim must roll Wits + Intimidation at a difficulty of the victim's Willpower (difficulty 8). Each turn, if the torturer has more successes than the victim does, the victim loses a temporary Willpower point. If the torturer and the victim are even or if the victim has more successes, the victim does not lose Willpower. The Storyteller must decide based on what kind of torture is being employed how often the victim takes damage. The torturers can keep building the rite until the victim runs out of Willpower and health levels. When the torturers have extracted all that they can from the victim (i.e., said victim runs out of Willpower and/or dies) the ritemaster rolls Wits + Rituals (difficulty 7). For a 20-foot radius per point of Willpower and health levels taken from the victim, the area is cleansed of Wyrm-taint (as if the Rite of Cleansing had been performed). Also, the Gauntlet in that area drops by two (to no lower than three) for one full month.",

        "description": "Hospitality is one of the three great virtues of the ancient Celts, and a similarly honorable virtue to the modern Fianna. Ordinarily, hospitality is a given at a hearth, but occasionally it needs to be formally stated in a binding fashion; perhaps the seeker is a rival, or has bad blood with others at the sept and needs protection. In such circumstances, the rite is performed. The grantor (typically the righ or the owner of the hall or territory) is required to give his guest food, shelter and reasonable comforts for three days, as well as protection from foes (without or within). In return, the supplicant is expected to be the model guest, neither stealing, starting fights nor otherwise bringing trouble to the household. And be sure that even if the offense isn't obvious, the spirits that witnessed the oath will find a way to bring it to everyone's attention. System: Typically, only the grantor needs to know the ritual. The supplicant formally asks for hospitality, usually reciting lineage and titles in the formal way. The host replies in formal language, granting her protection and a place in her hall. If the rite fails, the delivery seems forced and all present will feel the awkwardness of the moment. If successful, both parties are bound to their bargain. Should either one break the bargain, that party loses Honor Renown (-4 for the host, -2 for guest). Ordinarily, no Renown is gained if both live up to their ends of the bargain, but if there is an element of danger (guest and host are bitter rivals or even enemies, for instance) the righ and guest gain two and one temporary Honor respectively. If the righ is notably miserly, she gains but one point; if outstandingly generous, or required to go to great lengths to defend the guest (sustaining grievous injury, destruction of the hall, loss of honor, or something equally costly), she may gain three. The Storyteller should be careful that this doesn't become a font of 'free Renown'; Honor should be awarded only if there's something at stake - for instance, being a polite host to a guest that's insulted you or is a rival, or being a model guest despite constant provocation. After three days (usually measured to sunset, but typically stated during the rite), all bets are off; if the guest is in trouble, he'd better make tracks.",

There are many forms of divination available to Stargazers (or to anybody, really). Sciomancy is divination by shadows or darkness. Divination by smoke is called Capnomancy. Onomancy is the divination by the letters in a person's name. Tephramancy is divination by ashes, catoptromancy is divination by mirrors, and austromancy is divination using the wind as a guide. There are other popular divination tools, as well. The chosen form of divination ultimately doesn't matter, only that the Stargazer uses it and believes in it. The Stargazer lays out her divination tools as proper (which may involve throwing bones, dice, or standing on a peak and examining the winds). The items before her then literally become infused with their spiritual counterparts. Dice may begin rolling of their own accord, the winds may begin blowing and whispering in the Stargazer's ear, and ashes may hang suspended in the air and reveal a shadowy face. Secret truths are imparted to the Stargazer, though they are not particularly clear at first. System: The ritemaster rolls Wits + Rituals (difficulty 7). She must perform the divination for at least the scope of an entire scene. Each success on the roll to perform the rite allows her to 'collect' an additional Enigmas die that may be used at a later time. These added bonus dice do not need to be used all at once. (For instance, Matthias Heavens-Turning performs the rite and achieves four successes which translate into added dice for later Enigmas rolls. The next day he is trying to solve a particularly frustrating riddle given to him by his mentor, so he uses three of the four dice then. The following night he is stargazing, seeking truth about his own mission from the celestial bodies, and he adds his final bonus die to the Enigmas roll called for by the Storyteller.) The additional dice, if unused after 24 hours, go away. A Stargazer can only perform this rite once in a given week, and thus may not accumulate further bonuses by performing this rite several times in a row.",

Werewolves are not accorded adulthood or respect until they pass this seminal rite; they are mere cubs until that time. They are not even considered true Garou, and Shadow Lords do not refer to them as such until this rite is completed. Similarly, a cub is not a member of any tribe until his Rite of Passage. A male cub born to the Black Furies, for example, becomes a member of whatever tribe will offer him a place among them by use of this rite. During a Rite of Passage, the cubs must 'Complete a dangerous quest meant to prove that they have courage, honor and wisdom befitting a werewolf. However, few cubs undergo this rite alone. They are often joined by their pack-to-be, other cubs who are also coming of age. The ritemaster commands the would-be pack to go out into the world with a definite goal to achieve, and he forbids it to return until it has tried its best to accomplish this goal. Different tribes impose different goals, although multitribal septs usually reach a compromise. A Wendigo rite often takes the form of a vision quest, while the Get of Fenris commonly send their cubs into combat with Wyrm-spawn. Invisible spirits sometimes accompany the cubs in order to watch over them and report their doings to the elders. If the cubs succeed in their quest, a ritemaster performs this rite upon them, marking them with a pictogram that brands them as full-fledged Garou. These pictograms are usually painted, but the Red Talons carve them into the flesh of the young heroes. If the cubs fail, however, they are considered second-class citizens until they are granted another opportunity to prove themselves. System: Before the Rite of Passage, Garou are not yet Rank 1.

In the dying days before the Apocalypse, however, the Black Furies use magic to help them discern the best possible mates; after all, time is short, and wasting time breeding with a male whose bloodline is weak is no longer acceptable. Through the Rite of Pure Breeding, a Black Fury can determine if a particular mate will help her produce Garou or strong-blooded Kinfolk children. To test a male, the Fury must acquire something meaningful to him, or part of his body (no, not a finger, unless she's of the Amazons of Diana and he's really patient-hair or fingernail clippings do just fine). The ritual requires a droplet of the Fury's blood, smeared on the stolen thing. She then breaks it (or cuts it, if too small to easily break) over a white sheet and views the pattern created by the bloodstains. Symmetrical or circular patterns mean that the male would be a good mate and more likely to produce Garou children. Wilder, angular patterns suggest a worse match.

The quest always involves seven trials. These trials represent the seven gates that bar the way to the Underworld. Such trials vary dramatically from tribe to tribe, but there are always a variety of challenges presented to the members. One test might involve facing a Bane in combat, while another challenge might consist of finding a fetish lost within the Deep Umbra. Each test requires the participants to relinquish something of themselves, be it a cherished personal fetish, an old grudge or false pride.

The Children are committed to keeping this day alive in the minds of humans and Garou alike, and they work towards a time when all will be truly joined in love and respect for Gaia and each other. Prior to Earth Day itself, groups of Children attempt to spread the word to humans in co-ops and on campuses, wolves met at streamside, etc. They tell all that a rite of respect for the earth, our Mother, will be performed, its location and time. None are turned away from the Rite of Joining, be they human, Garou of any tribe, metis, or Kinfolk. The rite itself is led by two ritemasters: the female Voice of Gaia and the male Arm of Gaia. Together, the two ritemasters encourage all participants to join hands as the Garou leaders (in Homid form unless no non-Kinfolk humans are present) salute the East and the air of Gaia's kiss, the South and the fire of her embrace, the West and the waters of her love, and the North and the earth of her body. Finally, the two Children salute the spirit which joins each living being to every other one in the world.

Laying out a great feast representing all of Gaia's great bounty, often including spitted pigs, roast veal, corn, potatoes, wheat, chicken, bread, fruit, and more, the ritemaster and all participating Garou tell the tale of the Pure Lands before they were touched by the Wyrm's taint.

        "description": "Tribe: Silver Fangs. Time: August 2. The Rite of Long Remembering is performed by every Silver Fang sept on August second of every year. Although the date has been known by various names, this day is said to be the date when the first wolf crept into the World Navel and successfully saved Gaia when all other creatures had failed. The rite itself consists of a symbolic retracing of the first wolf's journey into the World Navel and subsequent victory over Darkness. The rite itself may well have hardly changed for thousands of years. The words are always howled out by the most beautiful-voiced Galliard of the sept, and the tune is as haunting and majestic as any howl known to Garou. The rite itself is highly stylized, as different Garou take the parts of the proud animals who tried and failed to aid Gaia; Darkness; the First Wolf; and Gaia Herself. Positions are assigned through a rigid status hierarchy, with the King of the sept always taking the role of the First Wolf. Once the Drama of the First Wolf has been reenacted, the Silver Fangs recite a grandiose history of their people that seems remarkably self-serving to the few members of other tribes who have heard it. The Silver Fangs manage not to mention the other tribes of Garou at all, except for a few references to the 'helpmeets' and 'little brothers' of the Silver Fangs. At the end of this long rite, the younger sept members are instructed to meditate strenuously on all they have learned and on their responsibility to carry on the great tradition of the Silver Fangs as preeminent among all Gaia's children. System: Botching this rite means incredible shame to the ritemaster, who loses one level of permanent Honor Renown. Any Silver Fang who does not attend this rite also loses much Renown (-3 Honor), and may even be shunned or punished in some other manner befitting one who has shamed his ancestors and himself.",

        "description": "In this rare rite, a werewolf rejects the auspice under which he was born and chooses a new auspice. The Garou must perform this rite during the phase of the moon he wishes to embrace. Most commonly, water from a silver basin exposed to Luna's radiance is poured over the naked supplicant, washing him clean of all he once was, including all rank. He is now free to start anew as a member of his adopted auspice. Almost free, that is, for many werewolves view such a A'Shifting Moon' with suspicion. The Shadow Lords and Silver Fangs in particular see this rite as a grave insult to Luna, and they are loath to trust those Garou who cannot bear the weight of their assigned burdens. System: A character who changes auspices must start anew at Rank 1. Although he may keep any Gifts he has already learned, he may never learn new Gifts from his old auspice. However, Gifts of his adopted auspice are now available to him. Sometimes this rite is performed for purposes other than shifting auspice, such as when a Garou wishes to give up his name and start over in Garou society. (See Renunciation, p. 185.) A variation on this rite also allows a werewolf to renounce his tribe and join a second tribe. Doing so, however, is a severe insult to his formal tribal totem, who will likely view him poorly for the rest of his days. In no case can a werewolf return to an auspice or tribe that he formerly renounced. He's made his bed, so he must lie in it.",

It allows the partial control of Rage at the price of violating a basic Garou law: the first precept of the Litany. The rite involves channeling the force of Rage by having sex in Crinos form. To avoid injury or death to the partners, both must be Garou. Because the fear of producing a metis is so great, metis are often asked to perform the rite, as they are sterile. Some Garou actually enjoy multiple partners while performing this rite, although having more than one sexual partner during the rite can be somewhat confusing. Some say that the more Garou are involved, the more powerful the rite becomes. The truth of this is unknown. System: The sexual partners invoke the spirits of peace and of desire, spending a point of Gnosis. They must demonstrate genuine affection for each other, or the rite will not work. If it works, the Garou can control the tendency to frenzy for the rest of the story. The Storyteller must determine the chance of pregnancy, if it is possible at all. Everyone involved in the rite loses a temporary point of Honor; the spirits who empower the rite, permissive though they may be, are still witnesses to the participants' transgression.",

Sometimes the spot upon which her heroic blood touched the soil needs a mark, even if the mark is completely invisible in the Realm. In such an instance, a Garou may enact the Rite of the Echoing Howl. While this rite can be performed with a pack or an even larger group, it is just as often enacted by one of the fallen werewolf's packmates. The ritemaster stands at the exact spot at which the hero fell (even if the Garou was taken away to die elsewhere), and walks in a small circle, counterclockwise. She then steps into the Umbra and howls as loud and long as she possibly can. If the rite is successful, that howl echoes for all time, reminding anyone who steps into the Umbra that a champion was lost on that spot. System: Standard roll. If the roll succeeds, anyone who can perceive spirits hears the howl faintly in the area, and anyone who actually steps sideways hears it as though the ritemaster were still standing there howling.

The ritemaster should prepare a layer of burning coals, wood chips, peat, moss, or caribou droppings. The participating werewolves then dance upon the fire, howling and capering, proudly declaring their imperviousness to the searing heat. Sometimes the dancers smear their paws or feet with layers of white clay, if such can be had, to prevent burns and blisters. They can also chew the leaves of several herbs known to reduce pain. Only these worldly natural gifts of Gaia, such as plants, animals, earth, or wind, may be used to protect a dancer from being burned. Mystical aids only drain more power, and so a fire dancer should never use another Gift, fetish, talen, or other rite to guard her from the fire. Wendigo believe that they should enact this rite on the night of the 13th full moon of each year. System: A fire dancer must roll her Stamina + Rituals successfully to take part in the rite without damaging herself. Together all the dancers must spend more combined Gnosis than five times the current level of the caern, in order to refresh the caern's power.

This ritual will not cause the subject to reveal other secrets he's been sworn to keep, but it will almost certainly cause him to reveal personal information that embarrasses only him. This rite can be rather humiliating, and many Garou who are subject to it find themselves overcome by Rage at their embarrassment. It is considered the height of dishonor to take retribution against a Garou who has used this ritual in a just fashion. System: This rite takes ten minutes to perform. The ritemaster symbolically carves a number of open-mouth sigils into bits of wood and distributes them ritualistically around the subject of the rite (who must remain more or less still during the rite, though he doesn't necessarily have to be willing). The ritemaster rolls Manipulation + Subterfuge (difficulty 7). For each success, the target suffers for one day from the effects described above.

The rite varies highly depending upon the breed performing it and the human culture (if any) surrounding the ritualist, but always possesses some common themes.

Once this is completed, the ritualist continues with a string of praises for the fetish and the spirit within the fetish. To complete the rite, the fetish is held above the ritualist's head and its name is chanted three times. System: The Rite of the Peacock is a Level Two Rite.

She does this by meditating and summoning the spirit, binding it into a prepared piece of food, and eating it. She then calls out the name of the ghost and chants aloud the essence of the unsolved matter, declaring that she has taken the matter upon herself to settle. The ritemaster is then compelled to right whatever wrongs keep the ghost from passing on peacefully. Only when the matter is resolved can the spirit find its way to its deserved next life in the afterworld. Since the ghost in question usually brings itself to someone's attention through its unquiet nature, it is much easier for a mystic to summon it. However, depending on how unsettled the spirit is, it may be conversely much more difficult to coerce it to cooperate with the rite, admit that it cannot solve the problem itself, and allow itself to be bound and consumed. Often other trusted kin of the spirit attend this ceremony and help the ritemaster to convince the ghost that the rite can help it. System: The ritemaster does not need to pierce the Gauntlet or enter the Umbra, as in most Mystic rites such as the Rite of Summoning, but she does need to spend a point of Gnosis in order to contact the spirit. The Storyteller should determine ahead of time what crime or sin has kept the ghost from passing on to the lands of its ancestors, and what clues this rite might provide the sin-eater to aid it. To bind the ghost to the piece of food, she must successfully make a Charisma + Intimidation roll against the difficulty of the ghost's Willpower. Once the binding has been achieved and the ritemaster has consumed the food, she makes a Charisma + Rituals roll against the difficulty of the ghost's Rage. The more successes she rolls, the easier it is for her to absolve the sin or find the source of the problem and solve it, restoring all things to their natural balance.",

Curiously, if the writing is less than one month old, enough of the author remains with the message that the ibis-spirit reads it in the author's voice. System: The player makes a Wits + Rituals roll (target 7). If successful, the ibis-spirit arrives and begins reading, and will continue for one hour per success or until dismissed. The spirit reads aloud in the language written - it does not translate the material.

At the center of the caern or Glade, the participants must carve and erect a wooden totem pole, decorating it with long straps of rawhide or caribou skin. At the top of the pole, a caribou skull should be affixed, facing northwards. At the end of each strap hangs a sharpened hook, sometimes made of silver. At sunrise, the ritemaster, or the Garou who will undergo the rite, allows the hooks to be fastened into her flesh. Once the hooks are secured, the participants encourage the werewolf with a Howl of Introduction, announcing her intentions to Helios and the spirit world. Then they depart, leaving her alone, and the Sun Dance begins. Frequently, the Garou also cuts or otherwise mutilates herself repeatedly for a maximum amount of pain, offering up her blood in sacrifice to Gaia and Great Wendigo. The Dance usually lasts until the werewolf rips free of the hooks or otherwise collapses, although the longer she can continue through the pain and blood loss, the more power she can draw to herself. System: The ritemaster or the invoking Garou makes a Charisma + Rituals roll to announce the rite to the Umbra. She then makes a Gnosis roll, and any successes above the single one required add to the effectiveness of the rite, which endows the Garou with increased blessings of Helios. Whenever the sun shines upon her, for the remainder of the month, she is guarded by mystic spirits of Helios, the power level of the summoned spirit constrained by the difficulty level of the rite, as determined by the Storyteller (as in the Rite of Summoning): Spirit Type - Difficulty: Gaffling: 4, Jageling: 5, Avatar: 6, Incarna: 8-9, Avatar of Helios: 10.

Most modern werewolves consider this mere superstition, but even such skeptics participate enthusiastically in the rite. The Rite of the Winter Winds is rarely the same from sept to sept. European Garou practice a common version that begins with the ritemaster gathering the Garou in a circle around a small bonfire. She then leads the group in an extended howl that begins as a low, rumbling growl and eventually rises to an ululating crescendo. When the ritemaster feels that the tension is at its height, she leaps forward, snatches up a burning branch and runs into the woods. The other Garou follow her, grabbing branches as they go. Running as swiftly as they can, the Garou make as many frightening and strange noises as possible. This rite is performed both to encourage Gaia's labor in giving birth to the sun, and to frighten off any minions of the Wyrm that might be lurking about, ready to snatch the newborn sun or harm Gaia as she turns her attention away from the surface world.

The City Farmers even take advantage of the principle to grow trees and vines up through lightwells, creating open, Gaian spaces within the huge buildings. The Rite of the Ziggurat unites and strengthens other rites. It is useful when two or more rites (even minor rites) are being performed atop one another in a multilevel structure. The use of intercoms, cell phones, and even closed-circuit TV and webcams makes this much easier. For example, a group of Garou Greeting the Moon could synchronize their actions with another pack consecrating a fetish two floors above and a Rite of Renown one floor up.

This rite invokes their power to bind a specific enemy to a particular location, even if only for a while. Calling on these Weaver-spirits is a potentially dangerous endeavor; if the rite is performed improperly, the snare-spirits will likely try to bind the ritemaster into the Pattern Web. But success can leave an enemy right where the ritemaster wants him; several vampires have gone up in four-alarm building fires thanks to this rite. Using this rite, a ritemaster must first walk, run, or otherwise move round the area to be bound. She must name that which she wishes to bind, and the name must be sufficiently accurate - 'the vampire who works in this building' is not precise enough, whereas 'the vampire who works in this building under the alias of Mr. Vincenzo' will suffice. She then invokes the trapping spirit, and 'ties a knot' round the area. If the rite is successful, the target of the rite will find it difficult to leave the area - barricades are harder to shift, doors lock themselves, and so on. System: The ritemaster rolls Wits + Rituals as usual. Each success on the rite locks one door, jams one elevator or otherwise seals one particular avenue of escape for the target. In addition, the difficulty of any rolls or feats of strength made to leave the area (such as Athletics checks to jump from roof to roof) is increased by 1 for each of the ritemaster's successes, to a maximum difficulty of 10. This rite is at its most potent when used with more mundane means of blocking exits, such as barricading doors or cutting phone lines. Note that this rite cannot restrict any other activities of the target that aren't directly related to leaving, nor can it prevent other people from assisting the target.

Doing so can be dangerous, though, especially in times such as these. Sometimes things go wrong. A packmate becomes caught in the Gauntlet itself, trapped between worlds. A werewolf is injured and alone in a Realm far from home, unable to return on her own. A comrade suffers the burden of Harano and walks among the spirits for too long, becoming disconnected from the physical world, forgetting who she is. A pack strays too far from the path given to them by their spirit guide and can't find their way back. In cases like these, this rite can be used to call the wandering soul back to where it belongs. The ritemaster builds a fire scattered with fragrant herbs, burns incense, smokes a large pipe of tobacco and herbs, or otherwise creates a great amount of strong-smelling smoke. Once the fire is lit, he drums and howls, beating the mother rhythm and calling out long and loud. The searching call echoes out across the Umbra, seeking the wandering one by name. In time, if she doesn't fight the call, the lost soul will arrive at the site of the rite, though she may need the ritemaster's help to cross over the Gauntlet. This rite can also be used to return a Stargazer's mind to her body if she becomes lost while traveling the Astral Umbra; in this case, it must be performed over her body, which is painted with glyphs in a combination of ochre and blood. System: The difficulty of the roll is equal to the target's Gnosis rating; the stronger her connection to the spirit world, the harder it is to call her away from it. This rite can be performed on either side of the Gauntlet, but if it's done from the physical world, the ritemaster must make the roll to pierce the Gauntlet and let the target through. It takes a number of hours equal to the target's Gnosis rating to complete the rite, so if the character is trying to call back a highly spiritual Garou, he should settle in for a test of endurance. The werewolf being called experiences a series of visions that symbolize the call and the journey, perhaps encountering dream-beings that resemble those performing the ritual.",

The prospective Black Fury must fast for 24 hours to purify her body; afterward, she enters a ritual circle while her tribemates-to-be quietly invoke Pegasus from outside the same circle. System: The invocation takes a few hours (the Mistress of the Rite should roll Charisma + Occult with a target of the local Gauntlet; the invocation takes 5 hours, minus one for every success after the first, with a minimum of 1 hour). At the end of this period, an avatar of Pegasus arrives. The prospective Fury must prove her worth to the avatar. This may involve a test, at the Storyteller's discretion, or it may simply involve a roll of Charisma + Etiquette (difficulty 7). A failure on this roll means that the Fury-to-be must complete a spirit quest to join the tribe; a botch means that she has somehow offended Pegasus and is not welcome to join. Should the character succeed, however, she is welcomed into the Black Fury tribe, and will be treated as a child of Pegasus from that point forward.",

        "description": "If a pup has, through acts of dishonor, offended an elder or the sept at large, the elder may prescribe this rite. This rite is basically looked on as a chastisement and a way for those involved to vent their frustrations so that all may go about their business. It's also a way to show Gaia the sept's disapproval, thus ensuring that Her anger isn't stirred. The elder who calls for the sanction is also the ritemaster. He escorts the subject to the place of punishment in silence, offering no hint of what is to come. Even if the pup guesses his fate, he is unlikely to attempt escape. It's his duty to stoically receive his just punishment, thus avoiding shame for himself and his sept. There the other Garou involved in the insult stand shoulder to shoulder, in two rows on either side of a path strewn with sharpened stones. The accused whelp stands at one end of this gauntlet, the ritemaster at the other. All present, with the obvious exception of the offender, carry stout branches, sticks or rocks. The rite commences in earnest with the declaration of grievances; the elder states his full name, the offense (often in shameful detail) and the full name of the accused. When he has finished, the punishment begins. The violent heartfelt howl loosed by all is the signal for the youngster to start his run. Feet slashed by stony shards, body bruised by clubs and hurled rocks, the guilty one must reach the end of the gauntlet. At the far end, between agony and freedom, stands the elder, weapon of choice brandished. If the cub has comported himself well, the elder may refrain from taking a shot himself. The European version of this rite is somewhat less ritualized and consists mainly of vicious pummeling; the stony shards are replaced with broken glass. System: The ritemaster must make a Charisma + Rituals roll against a difficulty of his own Rage to stop the ceremony from turning into a bloodbath and bringing more shame down upon the heads of the sept.",

Such abuse can harm the soul in ways still unknown to the Black Furies, but it is certain that sufficient abuse can open a hole wide enough for a Wyrmling to crawl into. It is in the Furies' nature to stop such a fate, and while it is their modus operandi to put a halt to such abuse (violently, if need be), Soothe the Scars is one of the Furies' best tools for healing abuse once it has been stopped. The rite itself is designed to put the victims at ease immediately; the smoke of gentle incense and scented candles should fill the air, and inoffensive soft music-not necessarily 'spiritual' music; folk songs or children's music are equally appropriate-should play. In the case of victims not acquainted with Gaian spirituality, prayers are offered to the 'spirit of motherhood across the world,' though prayers to Gaia can be said in their place. Memories of abuse are coaxed from the victim, and each one is symbolically cast into a purifying fire. When the rite is over, the victim can begin the long road to real spiritual healing without risking a fall backward into a dangerous cycle of self-degradation.

As each Garou receives the stone, he carves or paints a symbol of derision or shame onto it while telling a mocking or embarrassing tale about the offending behavior and other flaws of the scorned Garou. Moon Dancers are particularly creative in their verbal portrayals of the miscreant. This rite often lasts all night, with successive stories becoming more and more outrageous and derogatory. Once the night ends, so does the punishment, although the best stories are often whispered behind the offender's back for some time to come. Such behavior causes the Garou to lose Renown for a time.

The short hours of darkness offer the creatures of the Wyrm little place to hide, and the werewolves respond by holding a sacred hunt. Exactly at midnight, just at Midsummer begins, the ritemaster calls upon Gaia to bring to the attention of the sept a creature or creatures worthy of the Great Hunt. In preparation, the Garou chant, howl and tell tales of bravery. Also common is a ritual bloodletting, wherein each Garou cuts herself and sheds some of her blood into a large bowl. The mingled blood is then painted in the form of pictograms on the forehead or breastbone of each of the hunters. At dawn, Gaia sends the waiting sept a sign proclaiming the target of the Great Hunt. This sign may come in any form, from a vision seen by an entranced Wendigo ritemaster to a news story flashing on the screen of an old television in a Bone Gnawer caern. Although the person or creature chosen by Gaia is almost always associated with the Wyrm, Gaia demands on rare occasions that one of her own be sacrificed in the Great Hunt. Only the greatest warriors are ever chosen as the targets of a Great Hunt, and Gaia demands such a sacrifice from her children only in times of great need, for the freed spirit of such a warrior is said to transform immediately into an avenging angel for Gaia. The Garou have only until midnight to complete the Great Hunt. If successful, the blood of the fallen creature is spilled onto Gaia's soil (or into the ether if the Great Hunt takes place on the Umbra) as a sacrifice to Gaia. If the hunters fail to slay their quarry, it is considered a terrible omen for the coming year. Some Theurges say that no sept will succeed at the Great Hunt during the year of the Apocalypse. At the least, a failed Great Hunt means poor luck for the sept in the year to come. Anyone participating in a successful Great Hunt gains Glory. The danger of the particular Great Hunt determines the amount of Glory gained. System: Characters participating in a successful Great Hunt gain - presuming the target is of average threat level - three points of Glory Renown. If the Great Hunt is unsuccessful, each participating character loses two points of Glory Renown. In addition, the difficulty levels of all rites performed by the sept increase by one until the next Midsummer.",

Although summer is the traditional season of war among many human cultures, the Garou know that their shadow war will be all the more difficult during the lengthening hours of darkness. To prepare themselves, they hold the Long Vigil, a rite designed to sharpen their appetite for the battles ahead. The Long Vigil begins at sundown, around a raging bonfire (save in some urban caerns). The sept spends the day before the Vigil bedecking the caern with trophies of war collected during the previous year. From bent rifles and shredded flak jackets to broken Wyrm-fetishes and strings of teeth to the skulls of Wyrmish monsters to smeared blood mixed with the dust of vampires, all manner of mementos adorn the heart of the caern. As the sun slips below the horizon, the ritemaster begins to chant praise to Helios, thanking him for his blessings during the summer, and praying for his safety in the coming winter. The ritemaster then praises Luna and beseeches her aid in the long nights to come. To aid in the ritemaster's plea for aid, the Galliards of the sept come forward and begin to recite tales of the most glorious battles of the last year and the deeds done in her name. They point to each trophy in turn to tell the story of how it was won from its owner. Particularly eloquent members of other auspices who distinguished themselves in the previous year are sometimes allowed the honor of being the first to tell their own tales. Once the Galliards have finished, the other members of the sept begin to recount their own versions of the great deeds of the previous year. The tale-telling lasts all night; as dawn approaches, the ritemaster invokes Luna one final time. He dedicates all the deeds of the previous year to Luna, her brother Helios and her sister Gaia, and he promises that the year to come will be just as glorious with Luna's blessing. As the rite concludes, the Garou hurl as many trophies as possible into the bonfire, destroying their hard-earned mementos as a sign of faith that they will take many more in the year to come.",

The Rite of Shame is a way for Shadow Lords to secretly gain temporary Renown at a shadow moot without revealing their activities to the rest of the Garou. The spirits summoned during this variant of the Rite of Accomplishment are the same as the spirits summoned in a public moot. They will acknowledge successful tasks performed for the Garou Nation, but only other Lords will know of the actual events. The spirits are the great equalizer in this; they understand the darker truths behind the Garou. In this same sense, the Storyteller must ensure that this additional Renown has been earned. Pleasing the Grand Master of a shadow moot is not enough to earn Renown; the Lords must answer to 'higher authorities' as well. These temporary points cannot be used to gain permanent Renown until the Lord advances in Rank or gains a political position within the sept. In other words, once the Lord has succeeded in furthering his ambition, he may be able to justify his activities. Before his ascendancy, only other members of his shadow moot will know of and respect this renown, but once he gains power, he will receive further accolades. System: Depending on the Shadow Lord's deeds, the Storyteller may grant him temporary Renown for tasks that would not be deemed 'honorable' by other Garou. If the end arguably justifies the means, the Storyteller may award the Lord a fitting amount of temporary Glory, Honor or Wisdom. Let common sense be your guide - no Gaian spirit will acknowledge Renown for deeds worthy of the Black Spiral Dancers.",

        "description": "Two things are important to many Stargazers: the veneration of their ancestry and the tamping down of uncontrollable Rage. This ritual is an answer, somewhat, to both of these presumed Stargazer 'duties.' With this rite (which can only be performed under the werewolf's own birth moon) a Stargazer calls upon his ancestors to help him understand some mastery (however temporary) over his anger, wrath, and fury. The Garou must sit in the middle of an empty room, or if outdoors must perform the rite where there are no people within sight. Then, the Stargazer must concoct a makeshift shrine to his ancestors, cobbled together of items that were important to his ancestors or somehow symbolize the departed. Finally, the Garou must also place two slips of paper, one in each palm. On these slips of paper, called kangshin, there must be written a list of her ancestor's names. From there, the Stargazer meditates upon her antecedents, and seeks enlightenment from those who have come before him. Come morning, the werewolf will find that his Rage has been lessened. The primal fury within has been dampened, and up until the next dawn of his auspice moon, the Stargazer can try to deny any frenzy with a simple memory of her ancestor's wisdom. The vigor of the departed is thus transferred, for a short time, to the Garou. System: The Stargazer must perform the rite as described above. The player rolls Charisma + Rituals (difficulty 8). If even one success is obtained, the rite is successful. When successful, the Stargazer can attempt to deny any potential frenzy that may happen until the next rise of his auspice moon. The player may re-roll any failed frenzy check called for during this period; the results of the second roll stand. If the roll to perform the rite fails, nothing happens. If the roll botches, the Stargazer enters an instant frenzy that lasts for the remainder of the scene. This rite only functions when performed under the Stargazer's own birth moon.",

But this is not an ideal world. This is a world of darkness, and here the Dark Umbra manifests the ghosts of the restless dead in their obsessive agony. To protect a soul from this unnatural fate, a Garou mystic can perform this rite to help ensure that whatever business the dead soul may wish to resolve is less appealing than the call of the world's natural cycle of life. Since it's extremely rare, if not unheard of, for a werewolf's soul to become trapped as a ghost, this rite is usually performed to send off the spirits of humans (or, occasionally, animals) who died of violent or supernatural causes, or may have compelling reasons to linger. It's common for tribes to perform this rite for deceased Kinfolk. Some Garou perform this rite for slain enemies, not wishing to be the objects of otherworldly vengeance, although Wyrm-tainted corpses reject it out of hand. The ritemaster bathes the corpse in clean, cool water to calm any wrath the spirit might feel. Then he dances around the body in a circle while all those in attendance drum or stamp their feet and recite the name of the deceased over and over. They begin loudly, to attract the spirit's attention, and gradually get softer and softer over the course of the ritual until they whisper the name away into the wind, never to be spoken among them again. System: This rite will not work on a corpse that has been dead for longer than a number of hours equal to the ritemaster's Gnosis, or on the corpse of any being touched by the Wyrm. The difficulty of the roll is (5 + number of hours dead), to a maximum of 9. The spirit of the deceased does not linger as a ghost or appear in the Dark Umbra.

Leading enemies to the heart of the caern, frightening prey animals away from hunting Red Talons, and generally disrupting the harmony of the area with their very presence are all possibilities. The Red Talons developed (or learned from the Silent Striders, depending on whom one asks) this rite to drive off or forbid a human ghost from entering the bawn of a caern. Performing the Warding the Lingering Human rite requires the ritemaster to have a piece of the human's body or something that he touched in life (if this object was important to him, the rite works even more effectively). The Talon must then stand behind the object with his back to the caern and snarl, howl and bristle at the object.

When all seemed lost, Coatlicue crouched and gave birth to the child of her union with the sky-spirit, the god of fire and war Huitzilopochtli. Huitzilopochtli emerged from the womb full-grown and fully armed; he drove off or slaughtered the mass of his half-siblings in his mother's defense. With Birth the Fire Warrior, a Mother can mimic Coatlicue's desperate act of incarnation, and give birth to a warrior child spirit to fight on her behalf in times of peril. She must ingest a foul mixture of herbs, hot spices, and spring water, and then calmly and quietly invoke Gaia. The warrior emerges from the Mother's loins in a plume of fire, sword in hand, and proceeds to attack her enemies until it is destroyed or there are no enemies remaining. Birth the Fire Warrior can be used whether the Mother is pregnant with a real child or not, and its emergence generally does not affect a child in the womb. System: Roll Stamina + Primal-Urge (difficulty 8). Success on this roll indicates that the character will be able to birth the Fire Warrior.

Whether it's Cockroach and his tiny children, the machines that make us coffee and keep our juice cold, or the paperboy who never gets a word of thanks; we dedicate this day to keeping our relationships with others pure. To that end, we give gifts. We dump whole sacks of powdered sugar onto our kitchen floor overnight for the cockroaches, or spend time listening to the binary chatter of Net-spiders, or tip the boy a few hundred bucks. Septs often celebrate the Little Rite together as well with a massive gift to the minimum wage workers in the mail room below the caern, or with an all-out assault on the Banes in a Net-spider nest so that the thing is entirely clean. However we do it, the Little Rite makes sure that we don't forget anything or anyone. The city is made up of details, and forgetting any one of them is dangerous.

Then the ritemaster and all other able participants of the ritual cut themselves and proffer their blood as well, giving their strength in exchange for the great forces that must be put to work beneath the surface of the Earth. Some Garou have bled themselves to death during this ritual, in an effort to offer the ultimate strength of their spirits, as well as their blood, to preserve the lands of Gaia from being despoiled. System: The ritemaster rolls Charisma + Rituals to determine the success of the ritual, at a difficulty of 7. If she succeeds, she and every participant spend at least one point of Gnosis, and one Health Level in blood. The sum of the pooled Gnosis, in addition to the Ritemaster's extra success dice, measures how thoroughly the oil has been held back. Desired Result: Drilling equipment damaged by strata shift (5), Oil volume becomes irregular (6), Oil volume slows to a trickle (7), Oil stops completely, redrilling fails (8), Oil in surrounding acres disappears (9), Oil well spouts blood instead of oil (10).",

The spirits summoned with this rite will not teach the character anything or assist in the usual ways, but can be asked to help find a place, person or item within the Umbra. The rite involves calling out through a specialized dance and chant taught to the Garou as she learned this rite. System: Standard roll for performing this rite, but lower the difficulty by one if the character seeks a particular spirit whose name she knows. As usual, failed or botched rolls often involve angered or hostile spirits appearing (see charts under Rite of Summoning, Werewolf, p.161). When the spirit appears, it can lead the character or her pack to a Near Realm without difficulty. There is no further roll required here, but as customary it will want something in return for its services. It can also help search for a place or a person. The spirit is not omniscient, and can only help locate the target. The ritemaster gains five bonus dice to his Perception + Investigation rolls throughout the quest, as long as the spirit assists him. The spirit can also attempt to lead the characters to the Deep Umbra. In this case, stakes are much higher, and the characters may need to haggle a great deal (but not so much as to offend the spirit) to get a reasonable price. Also, the characters must locate an anchorhead themselves, and they travel into the Deep Umbra at their own risk. If the characters manage to persuade the spirit to accompany them on their entire journey, they will be able to return safely to the anchorhead.",

This rite is used to punish those whose cowardice endangered their packmates or Kin without actually causing their deaths (those cravens whose cowardice killed a packmate are more often subject to the Hunt, or worse). Although the Get primarily use this rite to punish other Fenrir-werewolves of other tribes are not expected to live up to the Fenris' high standards-they have been known to give the Coward's Brand to Garou of other tribes whose cowardice endangered several Get of Fenris. As the rite begins, the ritemaster repeats a litany of names, names of Garou who lost their lives from being abandoned by cowardly packmates. She then ritually names each packmate or Kinfolk that the accused werewolf abandoned and anoints the accused with blood drawn from each. At the conclusion of the rite, the ritemaster brands the sole of the offender's foot with a heated silver brand. The brand is permanent, an encouragement for the offender to never show his heels to his loved ones again. System: Standard roll. At the culmination of the rite, the offender takes two levels of aggravated damage and loses five temporary Glory and five Honor Renown. The brand cannot be removed by healing Gifts, even those that remove Battle Scars. Legend holds that a Fenrir who received the Coward's Brand managed later to atone with deeds of great valor. His reward came when Great Fenris appeared and bit off the branded foot, leaving him crippled but his honor fully restored.",

Unfortunately, for any humans who are within range of the Talons' howls, they may not be able to run far or fast enough to escape what so often becomes their own dirge. The rite is simple and to the point, although the Talons claim the rite has nuances even other Garou have lost the capability to understand. The Talons often point to these shadings as proof that they are the only Garou who remember the true mission of their people, who grasp the truth of their Mother's will. Although the Red Talons generally bow to the long-ago decision to end the Impergium, on this one night they throw off the burden of the ridiculous compact and enforce the Impergium again. The ritemaster, the Alpha of the pack, leads the howl recounting the halcyon days of the Impergium and the subsequent failure of the Garou when they repealed their sacred duty to Gaia. As the Howl ends, the Alpha leads his pack on a massive sweep of the pack's territory or beyond, searching out humans to cull from the herd. Although they seldom attack a whole town, ranches, campers, rest stops, and the like are commonly attacked. During the attack, the Talons continue the deep-throated, ululating growl that is the refrain of the Song of the Impergium.

        "description": "The Get of Fenris take to the Umbra every Samhain (October 31) to seek out the three wells at the base of Yggdrasil, the World Ash Tree. The Get claim that Yggdrasil is a vast splinter from the original World Tree of Gaia, whose three roots each draw energy and wisdom from one of the three facets of reality: Weaver, Wyrm, and Wyld. Some of the Get also claim that when the Apocalypse comes nigh, Yggdrasil will turn into a giant three-headed wolf or steed that will charge into battle with the Get, flames burning from its eyes, mouth, and paws. Other Get claim they must find one male and one female human to place in safety in the tree's branches, for no other humans will survive the Apocalypse and at least a few of them should do so. The three wells are known as Urd (the well of Wisdom and the Wyld), Mimir (the well of Honor and the Weaver), and Hvergelmir (the well of Glory and the Wyrm). During the night of Samhain, the Get make a pilgrimage deep into the Umbra to reach one or more of these wells. It is sometimes said that Yggdrasil exists at the center of the Get's Homeland, but others say the tree exists in a realm all its own. Regardless, the ritemaster must successfully seek out a well or suffer the sept's wrath and great personal shame. Upon reaching a well, the Get are always faced with a challenge. The nature of the challenge varies, although combat is common (especially at Hvergelmir). If the Get overcome the challenge, they may look into the waters of the well and catch glimpses of their individual fates, the fate of the tribe, and of the world as of that moment. Upon their return, the Get quickly go over any images they have glimpsed within the wells, and the elders interpret their meaning. There is little if any squabbling over the interpretations, for the Get do not waste time on such things. Fate is the Fates, and elders who are nearer to their inevitable embrace are best at knowing the minds of the fates. System: If the ritemaster fails the roll, the tribe will be unable to locate the World Ash Tree. Two successes indicate the ability to find two of the wells, and three or more means the sept may journey to any or all of the wells. A botch means the ritemaster leads the sept into a very dangerous place in the Umbra where they are attacked by spirits of some sort.",

Of them, Imbolc is considered the most important. All Fianna are expected to show up at their local seasonal moot and participate. Imbolc (Feb 1 - Feb 2): The most widely and rigidly practiced of the Fianna moots, we use this ceremony to drink faerie brew and travel to the Umbra, where the Fey show us signs and clues about the year to come. Imbolc marks the change from Winter to Spring. Beltane (May 1 - May 2): Still widely celebrated in different forms throughout Europe as May Day, Beltane is a fertility rite. Great fires are lit at night, and the Fianna salute Gaia and all Her glory. The Fey come and dance with the Garou around the Beltane fires, and it is a time for lovers to meet. More violations of the Litany occur on this night than any other, so the elders maintain a constant eye on the cubs. Many Fianna bring their Kinfolk to Beltane celebrations. Beltane marks the transition from Spring to Summer. Lughnassa (August 1 - 2): This night celebrates Lugh and his victory over the first fomori. It is a night for telling tales of glory and a time to recover from the wounds of the year. It marks the end of Summer and the beginning of Fall. Samhain (Oct 31 - Nov 1): This marks the end of the Fianna calendar. During the night of Samhain, we believe that it becomes easier for spirits to enter the material world. We spend this moot reciting the Silver Record and paying homage to the spirits of our ancestors. Usually, we hold a great feast on this night to celebrate life as well.",

        "description": "Many Garou and human women lack the ability to give birth on their own; perhaps they were born with congenital reproductive difficulties, or have become infertile due to the influence of Wyrm-created technology or chemicals. In the case of Garou, battle scars and similar wounds often lead to infertility. This ritual invokes spirits of fertility, often avatars of Gaia in the Mother aspect, to return fertility to those without. This ritual also improves any ordinarily fertile subject's chance of conceiving. The Fertility Rite does work on males, but it's almost never performed on them. It also works on wolves, and is occasionally used in secret by those Garou who have access to zoos and their wolf populations. The rite does not work on metis, not that Furies would be so arrogant as to try such a thing. The subject of the ritual removes all clothing save possibly a homespun robe, and sits or lays in an obviously growing area: in the midst of a healthy forest, or in tall grass. The Mistress of the Rite traces a circle around the subject, using the menstrual blood of a fertile woman. The Mistress of the Rite then invokes the spirits of Gaia for their aid in restoring the woman's birthright to her. In the case of battle scarring or injury, Gifts such as Mother's Touch may be brought to bear during the Rite, but those Gifts alone will not heal the woman's injury. System: At the heart of the ritual, the Mistress of the Rite should roll Charisma + Medicine (difficulty of the local Gauntlet) to heal the subject. Failure or botching has no further adverse affect on the target; otherwise, the woman's womb will be restored to health in (6 minus successes) weeks. If, rather than healing infertility, the Mistress of the Rite intends to improve an otherwise fertile woman's chances of conceiving, the number of successes should simply serve as a rough indicator to the Storyteller how much more likely it is that the character conceives. The ritual works similarly for men; simply change references above from 'conception' to 'impregnation' and the general rules apply.",

        "description": "All major astrological concolations are important to the Stargazers, but the lunar eclipses have special importance to this tribe. During such eclipses, many Stargazers embark on a rite known as a Sky Hunt. As in many things, the Stargazers differ from their brethren Garou when it comes to tribal rites. Sky Hunts are individual rites, or they involve at most a mentor and her student, for the Stargazers believe each individual must journey alone into the void to seek the truth of her own philosophy, just as the first Stargazer, Myridia (or Klaital or Mnemis or many other names beside), traveled to the End of the World only to find herself at its center. Any Stargazer capable of performing this rite inevitably journeys on her own Sky Hunt at the time of the lunar eclipse. The Stargazers believe Gaia's true light is easier to grasp during a lunar eclipse than at any other time. The dazzling light of the moon is a distraction, just as the obvious, the profane, can dazzle the eyes of the student from the quiet inner light of the sacred. When beginning a Sky Hunt, the Stargazer looks into a polished silver mirror, a pool of still water, or other reflective surface, and calmly watches the moon begin to disappear in shadow. As the first edges of the moon dissolve into darkness, the Stargazer wills herself to do likewise. She moves out of her body into the mirror, and from there into what some members of the World Tree camp refer to as the Astral Plane, or the Heavens or Upper World. While traveling this strange and fluid domain, each Stargazer looks for the truth in her own way. She can continue her Sky Hunt until the last shadow slips from the moon's surface, at which time she finds herself back in her body. Except for a certain number of the World Tree camp, the Stargazers are unable to enter this revelatory aspect of the universe except during the time of the Sky Hunts. System: Stargazers who successfully complete this rite actually enter the Astral Plane (or the Astral Umbra) for the duration of the eclipse. Their physical bodies remain behind, thus they may travel to places normally inaccessible to the Garou. If the rite is botched, the Garou separates from her body but is unable to enter the Astral Umbra. Such a Garou is trapped until someone covers the reflective surface used in the rite. Stargazers have been known to become forever lost in such situations, their bodies dying while their spirit lives on. It is a terrible thing, since they may not be reclaimed by Gaia until they find a way to return to their bodies and true death. More details on the Astral, or Upper, World can be found in Mage sourcebooks.",

These two aspects both feed Find the Scythe, which allows a Crone to determine the means by which a given Garou will meet her end. This ritual does not work on humans. Find the Scythe can be performed on a willing or unwilling subject, but the subject must be present for the ritual to work properly. System: The Crone must inspect the Garou from all angles; to accomplish this, she walks clockwise around the stationary subject while looking across her right shoulder at him. When this is complete, she inspects the top of his head, and the lines on the bottom of his feet. After half an hour of meditation on all that she has seen, roll Perception + Enigmas (difficulty 9 if the subject is a Maiden by Fury standards - regardless of her tribe - or 8 if she is a Mother, or 7 if a Crone). If successful, the Crone will be able to describe the manner of death that will befall this Garou. A failure results in a vision that is incorrect in one important detail (the character's killer uses a gun, not a klaive, for instance); a botch indicates a vision that is wildly inaccurate, preferably a vision that will unnerve the subject as much as possible. The Storyteller is free to describe this vision in whatever means he sees fit, and the Fury is equally free to pass the vision off in her own manner. The vision is occasionally metaphorical, though it is often quite literal. However, it is generally somewhat impressionistic; for instance, it might be obvious that a black-furred werewolf will rip the character's heart out, but that werewolf's identity will be unclear. Find the Scythe is a dangerous rite, because it seems to ferret out the absolute truth of a future event. No amount of wheeling and dealing with the spirit world will alter the death shown through Find the Scythe. This may cause Storytellers some headaches, and they are encouraged to think quickly on their feet to cope with the results of Find the Scythe. Remember, Storytellers, vagueness can be a virtue.",

In the last few years, the Order of Our Merciful Mother camp of Black Furies has begun to develop a rite similar to this one, which works in appropriately spiritual parts of cities. The Order has approached some Freebooter Theurges for aid with the rite, and that collaboration seems to be leading down a fruitful path. System: First, find an appropriately pristine patch of wilderness by rolling Perception + Survival, difficulty 9 after a week's worth of investigation. Success on this roll will indicate a broad swath (perhaps a square mile, or even more) with high enough traces of the Wyld that the characters might find a suitable home for a caern within. This roll will automatically fail if the wilderness the character investigates is unsuitable for a caern; if this is the case, success on the Perception + Survival roll will correctly indicate that the entire area is unsuitable. A botch on the Perception + Survival roll may, at the Storyteller's discretion, suggest a particularly inappropriate location (one with a history of Wyrm or Weaver activity) for a prospective caern. Then, spend a point of Gnosis and roll Perception + Enigmas (difficulty 9) to carefully explore this swath of land for a low enough Gauntlet and the favor of the spirits. The Garou must collect ten successes on this extended roll; each roll and Gnosis expenditure represents three days of communing with the spirits and cautiously investigating the terrain. Note that if multiple Freebooters in the same pack have this Gift, they can pool successes, but the investigation still takes a minimum of three days to complete. Once a sufficient number of successes have been gained, the Furies still must use the Rite of Caern Building (or Bearing the Caern, below) to actually create the Caern. This Gift simply points out the best location for such a thing to be done.",

This imbalance manifests in many ways, from a Wyld-fed madness to Wyrm-spawned depression or the joyless routine of the Weaver. Packs delving into Cyber realms for extended periods or conducting raids on Black Spiral Dancer Hives come back changed, Tainted. This rite seeks to bring them back into balance, to restore the Garou's harmony with Gaia. System: The ritual varies depending on the relative strength of each of the Triatic influences within the subject. The ritemaster and her assistants paint glyphs and sigils of power on the subject, followed by a bath in a stream to wash away the markings (this cleansing ritual is similar to the rite Washing the Spirit, given in Croatan Song). Then, in a medicine lodge or other neutral place, the ritemaster conducts a series of chants and songs and drumming, using sacred herbs, bones and stones, as well as a sacred fire. At the end of the rite, the player rolls Wits + Rituals (difficulty 7, higher if the Taint is particularly strong). Three successes completely restore the balance within the subject, while fewer successes indicate partial cleansing. In addition, the untainted subject regains one Gnosis point. The rite lasts half a day and usually begins at sunrise or sunset. For particularly strong Taints, the rite may be repeated up to three more times (but must be held consecutively, with no one leaving the lodge). At the beginning of each repetition, the ritemaster must make a successful Stamina + Rituals roll (see Endurance and Rituals, below. Alternately, if you use the 1-5 Taint rating system given in the Players Guide to the Garou, the difficulty will be 4 + Taint level; each success decreases the Taint rating by one). Note that when a Taint runs more deeply, performing this rite alone won't cure it. Taints bought as Merits or Flaws must be bought off with experience points, and usually require a more rigorous treatment (often a quest to a sacred place of balance). This rite treats symptoms - a Triatic Imbalance - without addressing the cause. Someone recently exposed to Wyrmish spiritual energies could be brought into balance, while a Fomori still possessed by a Bane would regain his Taint immediately.",

The rite, however, cannot tell the Garou anything about the disposition of the Kinfolk; neither does it reveal Wyrm-taint or other supernatural influence.

Although a would-be Jarl need not know this rite to challenge the current sept leader, this rite is accepted as the most formal and proper way to do so. Proper performance of this rite marks the challenger as one well-versed in Fenrir ways and worthy of facing the Jarl in challenge, and therefore adds extra weight to his claim to the position. Get of Fenris may also perform this rite to formally challenge rivals of other tribes or positions; the rite has less binding power in such occasions, but still (if performed properly) carries great weight. The challenger must be the one to perform this rite. He must confront his opponent and formally recite his lineage, deeds, and strengths, each one a full declaration of his worthiness. He then calls out each of the reasons for his challenge-which must be carefully done, as the accusations must be strong enough to win the onlookers' support, yet not so bold as to provoke the challenged party to frenzy. With the final accusation, he formalizes the challenge. If the rite is performed properly, the challenged party must accept or lose significant Renown. System: Standard roll of Charisma + Rituals. If the rite is failed, the challenged party may refuse to accept the challenge (and if both were Fenrir, it would be a disgrace to acknowledge a challenge so poorly made). If the rite is successful, the challenged party cannot refuse the challenge without losing Renown (1 Glory for non-Fenrir, 2 Glory for Get of Fenris, 5 Glory if a Jarl). The ensuing combat may be to first blood, submission, or even to the death, at the Master of the Challenge's discretion; the more successes, the more likely the Master of the Challenge is to choose duel terms in keeping with the challenger's wishes. No weapons may be used during the combat. If the Fenrir uses this rite to challenge someone who is clearly not his equal in battle, he promptly loses 1 Glory and 2 Honor, and the challenged party may decline without fear of Renown loss no matter the result of the roll. The only exception is if the challenged party is a Jarl; a Jarl who is clearly inferior to his challenger is an affront, and should be replaced as quickly as possible.",

However, the spirit of Great Wendigo can bestow an even greater strength upon the bonds among his tribe. During this rite, the ritemaster may learn to combat Derangements that another Wendigo close to her may possess - even the Derangements of a metis, although she must be of Wendigo blood. The two Wendigo must belong to the same pack, and both the characters must have fought together in a battle where the werewolf's Derangement has taken hold and caused a defeat to their pack or sept. A controlled situation is set up, preferably with the target Garou's knowledge, to cause her to become Deranged. At her side, offering complete trust, the ritemaster as deliverer guides them both through the ritual, fully sharing in and enduring the effects of this Derangement alongside her, forging a link between them through the Umbra. Through this bond, the deliverer forces her will upon the Derangement, subduing it herself, and then lends courage and support, aiding the Deranged character to do the same. When the effect of the Derangement has been mastered, the two linked Garou both complete the ritual by calling upon the spirits of Gaia and Great Wendigo and offering thanks. System: The rite itself begins with the triggering of the Derangement. The ritemaster then spends a point of Gnosis and makes a Wisdom + Empathy roll against her target's Willpower, to share the Derangement. Finally, the ritemaster must then make a successful Willpower roll of her own (difficulty 5) to gain enough control to complete the rite. For every failure, the difficulty rises by one point. If she succeeds, the target character may resist her Derangement for the next lunar month. If the rite should fail, then the ritemaster absorbs the target's Derangement, instead, for the same period of time.",

She must then find something that holds her attention; the movements of clouds in the sky, a parade of ants marching to their home, the swirling of running water - any of these will do. The supplicant simply allows her mind to unfocus and waits for the vision from Gaia. The vision thus granted may be helpful and might well grant the Red Talon some insight into an immediate problem. However, Red Talon 'history' is fraught with tales of Talons who have foreseen events such as nuclear blasts, the War of Rage, the War of Tears, and battles that might or might not be the Apocalypse itself - and simply haven't been able to interpret the visions in time. While nearly every Master of the Rite at a Red Talon caern knows the Rite of Prophecy, they rarely use it. To know the truth, but not what the truth means is more painful than most Garou can bear. System: The player rolls Willpower (difficulty 7) to focus the character's attention, and then rolls Wits + Rituals (difficulty 7) to begin the vision.

By means of this rite, a Garou of another tribe loses his tribal affiliation and instead becomes a Stargazer in blood, if not by birth. The Garou wishing to become a Stargazer may not perform this rite herself; it must instead be performed upon her by an able and willing ritemaster. In this rite, the ritemaster must take the Garou beneath the new moon and together they must stand in a body of running water (a creek, stream, or river will do). The ritemaster must, with a claw, etch the Stargazer glyph into the Garou's body, and let the blood mingle with the flowing water below. The Garou mustn't let this wound heal right away, and instead must allow it to scab over and become a natural scar. After seven days have passed, the Garou is now a full-blooded member of the Stargazer tribe regardless of her tribe of origin. System: The rite is performed according to the description above. The player rolls Charisma + Rituals (difficulty of the Rage + 2 of the changing Garou, to a maximum of 10). The river washes away a Garou's tribe, and it also removes any semblance of Rank.

The results would look something like this: Using duct tape and at least one cardboard box, the ritemaster dedicates the box so that it's much larger on the inside than it is on the outside. This involves creating a 'pocket realm' of the Umbra accessible to anyone with the Gnosis Trait. The box must at least be large enough for the ritemaster to crawl inside, along with a flap that can open and close.

Stories have given it different forms and names - a reindeer, a coffin, a dipper, a chariot for kings, a spurned maiden - but in most legends told by Gaia's people, it takes the shape of the Bear. One of the oldest legends tells of three stars, the bright spirits of three brave warriors. Throughout the year they pursued their prey, a pure white bear bigger than all three men put together. When autumn came, their spears finally found their target, and the blood of the Great Bear dripped down from the heavens, to turn the leaves of all the trees red as he died. This rite celebrates the fierce and determined spirits of these three Star-Hunters, by sending three brave new avatars back into pursuit of a single target of the ritemaster's choice. For the Rite of the Great Hunt, a sept or a ritemaster is usually sent a vision from Gaia, indicating a worthy victim or sacrifice. In order to add to this rite a hunt for the Great Bear, the Spirit of Great Wendigo conveys his own, separate message and target, but to the ritemaster alone. A ritemaster must be confident in her bond with Gaia and Great Wendigo, and also confident that her septmates are willing to trust her vision and risk shame to achieve even greater glory. Although Gaia has been known to sacrifice one of the Garou as the quarry for Her rite, Great Wendigo never chooses one of his children as the target.

Once bound, the Garou cannot be moved or handed off to someone else without freeing him. Through Gaia's grace, only one of her Philodox can hold the 'leash.' However, if the offender is later found innocent, the Garou who cast this rite loses 5 temporary Wisdom. Casting the rite over trivial offenses also results in a loss of Wisdom.",

Fenrir often bolster their self-control at formal moots with this rite, which soothes the Rage of participants so that they can avoid diplomatic events. To enact this rite, the Get must be inside a house pleasing to the spirits in some respect; the lodge-houses, longhalls, or other structures within a Get caern are ideal, but any building that's been marked as open to the spirits of Gaia will suffice. The ritemaster opens each door and window in turn, inviting in the spirits of wisdom and granting the spirits of Rage permission to leave if they see fit. If the rite is performed correctly, those within the lodge are much less likely to lose control of their Rage until the meeting ends. System: Standard roll; if successful, the rite's effects last until the first person leaves the lodge. While the rite's effects are in place, any shapeshifters within the lodge are calmer than usual; the difficulty of any Rage roll made within the lodge has a difficulty of 9 (although Rage may be spent without restriction).",

A leader needs respect from those that follow him if he (and they) wish to succeed. Usually, only packs that have been working together for some time and who trust each other enough to further cement those bonds perform this rite. The rite makes the whole pack's focus and commitment dependent on the pack alpha. In effect, they submit completely to him, in the hope of gaining an advantage from it if he is committed to working for the benefit of all. Each member of the pack must take a small item of personal significance and a length of his or her own hair and give it to the ritemaster. She then binds together all the objects using the hairs and buries the bundle within the pack's home caern. System: The player of the werewolf enacting the Rite rolls Charisma + Rituals (difficulty 9 - the pack alpha's Leadership). If the roll succeeds, the entire pack gains two extra points of Willpower per chapter as long as the pack alpha is acting in the best interests of the whole pack. However, if the alpha has not been doing so, the entire pack loses two points of Willpower for the chapter. The gain or loss is entirely at the Storyteller's discretion.

        "description": "It is often the duty of the Ragabash to add levity and defuse a tense situation. When division and anger threaten the unity of the sept, some Ragabash choose the dangerous and often sacrificial Rite of the Omega. Once it is performed successfully, the ritemaster becomes reviled; everything she says or does steps on the last nerve of everyone in the sept (plus any visitors there at the time the rite begins). Elders put her to work and punish her for being slack, and the Ahroun want to practice their Ragabash-throwing skills. Even the lowest metis says, 'Sucks to be you.' The ritemaster will be driven from kills, suffer beatings if she isn't quick, and may even have her gear stolen or damaged for spite's sake. Even her own pack treats her like dirt. All the tension and hate and anger that threatened to tear the sept apart is now directed at one individual, bringing unity and catharsis to the Garou. The effects last a minimum of one day, although for an ongoing situation the Ragabash may continue to play the ultimate omega to ensure harmony. System: Using her own blood mixed with the soil from the caern site, the ritemaster inscribes the Garou glyph for Shame on her chest and intones a chant. If successful, the Ragabash drops to Rank One for the duration of the rite. If the tension in the sept is the result of a singular event (a death, a divisive challenge, etc), the rite's effects last a single day. In the case of an ongoing crisis (intersept negotiations or a heated conclave), the rite may last as long as a week. At the end of the rite, the glyph disappears and the Ragabash's Rank is restored, plus 3 temporary Honor (up to 5 for an extended rite) and hopefully some decent treatment to make up for the sacrifice. The sept members will be more inclined to compromise and have greater understanding of opposing views, staying unified for a time. The put-upon ritemaster may end the rite prematurely simply by wiping the glyph away and shouting 'I've had enough!', but loses 2 Honor and 1 Wisdom, and worse, the sept loses all benefits of the rite. This is specifically a Ragabash ritual; any other auspice (assuming they can find a teacher) has a +2 difficulty to the rite roll and gains or loses only 1 Honor.",

This rite allows two warriors who have fought together for some time to dedicate themselves to each other as sisters or brothers in arms, forging a bond in blood and strife that can only be broken by death or betrayal. Ritemasters are careful to assess the relationship between the two petitioners before consenting to perform this rite, ever mindful of the Litany. While most tales involving battle mates are inspirational, a few are tragedies that teach would-be mates not to grow too close to each other. The ritemaster performs a chant that details the battles the two werewolves have fought together, both victories they achieved and defeats they survived. The participants cut themselves, and mix their blood with a hallucinogenic brew. When the drugs take effect, the ritemaster appears as a monster that the two petitioners must fight, trying to restrain their Rage enough not to kill her. At the culmination of the rite, they recite a blood oath: never shall one leave the other behind on the battlefield; never shall one fail to come to the other's aid in a time of need; never shall one betray the other to the enemy. System: If the rite succeeds, the ancestor-spirits recognize the two warriors as true battle mates and give their blessing. As long as neither mate goes back on her word, the characters each gain one Willpower point and one Rage point per scene in which they fight together against a common foe, and they each gain one point of temporary Glory Renown when they emerge victorious over that foe. If at any time the blood oath is violated, both Garou instantly know it, and lose five points of Honor Renown and one dot of Willpower each. The mate who was betrayed, left behind, or abandoned must make a Rage roll to see if she frenzies.",

Only walls and doors made of wood or carved from rock may be the subject of this rite. Glass, steel, or any alloyed metals are unaffected as they are too far removed from Gaia's natural materials. Most other tribes believe this rite is heretical, and hold its practice against the Warders during moots. Warders are careful to reserve this rite for the protection of their Kinfolk and their caerns. System: The ritemaster must acquire an object similar to the item to be strengthened. For example, a piece of stone of the same type (such as granite) as those making up a rock wall could serve to protect the wall. If the object is a perfect match for the target, such as a stone from the same quarry as the rock wall, then the difficulty of the rite drops by 2. Smaller objects are also easier to strengthen than larger ones. Anything smaller than a wall, such as a door decreases the difficulty by 1 or more, at the Storyteller's discretion. Likewise, attempting the rite on an entire castle wall would increase the difficulty by 2 or 3. The participating Garou must walk the length of the object to be strengthened, while calling on Gaia to restore the wood or stones to their natural living strength. If successful, all difficulties to damage the structure will increase up to a maximum of 3 until the end of the next full moon.

        "description": "Desire, in and of itself, is unavoidable. Everybody wants something, and few Stargazers deny this. However, many Stargazers also openly deny their own desires, giving in only to the beneficial desires of others (or the desires of the world). Lust, greed, gluttony - these traditional 'sins' are also the seeds of desire that afflict all. Stargazers would seem the model of desire denial, and many of them are. Unfortunately, however, this repression also lends itself to the theory that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and sometimes tamping down one's own desires causes them to pop up later at twice the strength. The longer one denies, sometimes the harder it is to deny the sweet succor of want. This ritual helps curtail that, to a degree. When performed, it literally gives spiritual form to a Stargazer's desires, in the form of an Urge-Spirit. In the Umbra, around the Stargazer, the Urge-Spirit manifests and can thus be communicated with, defeated, or even bound into a fetish. If the spirit is thus diminished, so are the Stargazer's prevalent bad desires. This rite is only performed on those Stargazers found truly desirous of negative things, however. For instance, a Stargazer with a bad chocolate habit or unrequited love in his heart doesn't usually count as one who is besieged by negative urges. Only those Stargazers who are plagued by grievous desires (or who have already given into them) are the subject of this rite. A Stargazer who is addicted to pain medication (or, alternatively, pain) is a good choice, as is a Stargazer with a dangerous love of money, women, or alcohol. The ritemaster must spend at least eight hours in the company of the afflicted. After the eight hours is complete, the ritemaster must speak the mantra of desire (Aum-Klim) over the subject before blowing bone dust in the subject's face. System: The rite must be performed as above. The player rolls Charisma + Rituals. The difficulty begins at 10, and is reduced by the number of Willpower points spent. Both the ritemaster and the subject of the rite can spend Willpower to reduce the difficulty of this roll. The successes achieved determine the temperament and demeanor of the Urge-spirit that manifests according to the following results: Successes | Effects 1 | Spirit comes eventually and is initially hostile 2 | Spirit manifests quickly, but is still initially hostile 3 | Spirit comes immediately and is neutral 4 | Spirit comes immediately and is passively benign 5 | Spirit comes immediately and is friendly If the roll botches, there are disastrous consequences. The Urge-spirit doesn't manifest, but becomes Wyrm taint that afflicts both subject and ritemaster. If the Urge-spirit is successfully summoned and dealt with, the subject is clean of the negative desire (although it may grow strong again if unchecked). If the spirit isn't successfully dealt with and is allowed to escape and return 'home' to the Stargazer at the end of the scene, the subject loses one point of Wisdom renown, and the ritemaster loses two. The Urge-Spirit has the following Traits: Willpower 7, Rage 9, Gnosis 5, Essence 20-30 Charms: Materialize, Blast, Corruption.",

This rite allows the Uktena to trap a spirit in a cage of energy. System: The Uktena creates a circle (usually less than 9 feet in diameter) in the physical realm. The circle is often made of flint or obsidian chips, but sometimes of candles or burning wood. Succeeding in the Wits + Rituals roll (difficulty 7) primes the cage; when the spirit has been lured to the circle, the ritemaster spends a Gnosis point to spring the trap. The Penumbral air around the spirit comes alive with spiritual representations of the circle - in the above example, that would be rapidly whirling slivers of obsidian or leaping tongues of flame. The barrier inhibits the use of most Charms. To push through the barrier, the captive has to score more successes on a Rage roll (difficulty is the ritemaster's Wits + Rituals) than the ritemaster had. Even if it manages to push through it, it suffers Aggravated damage equal to the ritemaster's successes. This works both ways. Garou cannot breach the circle without damage, although the ritemaster can drop the cage at any time. The rite lasts an hour per success, and each additional Gnosis contributed extends the duration by an hour. However, if the circle is disturbed (a candle flickers out or the boundary is broken), the power collapses.",

This rite calls on the Blood Lunes, spirits of lunar eclipses and the far side of the moon. These elusive Jagglings see all but say little, lurking just beyond sight wherever moonlight shines. A werewolf who coaxes them out properly can draw on their abundance of ancient observations from unseen corners of the world, asking questions about the history of an elusive subject and receiving a cryptic shadow play in answer. Blood Lunes don't usually care about knowledge that's known by many, and they tend to forget it. They only retain secrets, and so only secrets can be learned from them. This rite doesn't actually summon the Blood Lunes into the material world, if performed there; it only draws them close to the Gauntlet to pass on their hints. This rite must be performed during the full moon, when its light shines fully on a surface. The Garou must have some physical representation of the subject of her inquiry on hand. This could include a lock of hair or a severed finger, a carved bone resembling a spirit, sand from a particular beach, or even a photograph. She sacrifices a nocturnal animal - usually a bat - then takes awakened psilocybin or peyote. Having done so, she places the token on the ground, lets her shadow fall upon the bright surface, and dances. As she does, her shadow acts out her questions in symbolic gestures. She must repeat these motions until her shadow separates from her and acts out its own story. Other shadows join it, presenting an enigmatic tale that she must interpret for clues that answer the questions. The tale may not even obviously reference the subject of the query, but with the proper interpretation, she can still glean meaning. System: The player rolls Wits + Enigmas with a difficulty based on the obscurity or specificity of her subject. Well-known or broad subjects such as the Garou Nation, World War I, or the Weaver are difficulty (7 - Rituals). Slightly narrower or more obscure subjects such as a particular mountain range, the Silver Fangs' tribal lore, or a corporate merger are difficulty (8 - Rituals). Coaxing out Blood Lunes who know about very narrow or arcane subjects such as a particular lost tome of wisdom, an individual not widely-known, or an agreement made between two spirits is difficulty (9 - Rituals). For each success on the roll, the werewolf learns one secret about the subject's past, couched in mystery and symbolism. The more successes the player rolls, the easier to interpret these hints should be.",

Few Stargazers practice it; it's mostly prominent among the Stargazers of India, despite the fact that its origins actually lie among the native peoples of Malaysia. At its roots, Thaipusam is an act of ritual piercing. The Stargazer, after washing his hands in both milk and honey, then pierces his own flesh to insert a ring. While chanting the universal mantra (aum), salt is rubbed in the wound to heighten the pain and ensure that it won't heal over immediately. The ring itself needn't be made of any specific material, though many Stargazers favor simple rings of steel, jade, or hematite, though some decorate their bodies with more ornate trimmings. The bodily location of the piercing also is insignificant. Many pierce their ears, lips, nipples, and some even go so far as to pierce genitals, the flesh around the throat, or bunches of pinched skin around the forehead. Many elder Stargazers can be seen with countless rings adorning their scarred bodies. System: The player rolls Stamina + Rituals (difficulty 7).

With these two elements in place, they do not need the criminal to be present to pass judgment on him. System: After a suitably bloody and fiery destruction of the weapon, roll Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty 7). If they succeed, the Furies invoke the spirit of Hippogriff to rend the criminal's youth away.

The Garou used to rule the wilds, but humanity encroaches more and more on their ranges. Hundreds of years ago, Theurges developed a rite with which to frustrate such expansion. This rite, Enchant the Forest, awakens the spirits of the land and urges them to protect the Wyld. These spirits awaken and move to resist any human settlements in the area. Suddenly, springs dry out. The winter grows harsher than ever before, yet the forest and the trees are remarkably fast-growing and resilient. Food decays and rots in no time, and vermin and insects infest the area. Attempts to lay in power or phone lines fail inexplicably. Not to mention the TV reception, which displays disturbing, unusual images when it functions at all. The humans eventually either leave or die, and the wilderness will reclaim its lost property.

The ritemaster takes a twig from a tree never seen by human eyes, and makes a container from the belly of an animal never hunted by humans, which he fills with water from a pond never touched by mankind. He then stirs the water, and pours it close to the borders of the wild woods, and calls on the spirits of nature to awaken and defend themselves. He sends messengers to the north, south, east, and west, to call to the spirits there. The ritemaster must sing to the spirits for three days. System: The immediate effects of this rite last for a full lunar year, if not disrupted by some sort of supernatural intervention. The area so charmed cannot exceed the furthest distance the messengers have traveled by foot in the three days. Larger areas can sometimes be ensorcelled, with the expenditure of a Willpower point, and an addition of +1 to the difficulty per mile beyond. If the Garou's caern is located within five miles of the ritual location, the difficulty is reduced by one. Larger caerns, at the storyteller's decision, can call to the spirits of a wider area. Whole swathes of the Black Forest, for instance, are thus 'haunted.' If tribal totems are called upon, the protected area retains a little of the character of the totem or the tribe. Fianna areas retain a little of the faerie aura, Get areas are colder and boast harsher weather, Shadow Lord domains are haunted by terrifying, ghostly creatures. Some even claim that the Glass Walkers have developed a version of this rite, which allows them to enchant areas of cities, and claim them for Cockroach.",

        "description": "This rite is forced upon a Stargazer who has committed a grievous sin against sept or tribe. It is reserved for one who has brought deep shame to himself and others. The Stargazer's hands are bound, and he is led over a period of months to a number of Stargazer holy places. At each caern, the offending Garou must eat ashes while the caern guardians condemn and then ignore the Stargazer. At the final caern, upon completing this grim pilgrimage, the Stargazer's entire identity and memory fall away, toppling like a house of cards that can never be rebuilt. He becomes tabula rasa, a clean slate, unable to regain the most simple and intimate of memories-not even his own name. Most of the tribe views this rite as the utmost of punishments, but a rare few view it as a reward. Some believe that one of the highest states of being is actually a state of non-being, and they seek to have this rite performed upon them so that their souls may transcend. There is an even lesser-held belief that this rite is useful for curing Harano; however, to make that worthwhile, one would have to find a way to allow the old memories and identity to resurface after the rite is completed. As of yet, nobody has come forth with a means to make that happen. System: The ritemaster must travel with the Stargazer to be punished, escorting him to a number of caerns equal to the offender's Rage score. The punished must be taken to the very heart of each caern, where each guardian congregates, aiding in the ritual as defined above. Once this pilgrimage is completed and all caerns have been visited accordingly, the player rolls Charisma + Rituals (difficulty of the offender's current Rank + 4). If successful, the punished Garou loses all Renown and must start anew. He also loses his identity and all the memories associated with it. All other Traits, however, remain the same. If this rite fails, it's assumed to be a sign from the Emerald Mother that the offending Stargazer can be redeemed by other means. A botch on this roll means that the ritemaster loses five points of Wisdom, and the offending Garou loses nothing (including his memory).",

It organizes all the spirits in a given region into ecological harmony: Weaver, Wyld, and even some Wyrm beings can enter into a state of coexistence like the numerous entities of a coral reef. The peace produced by this powerful rite is that of Gaia, not the Weaver. Conflict and death will not cease, but the overall functioning of the system will be balanced and harmonious; humans, Garou, animals and spirits will all know this on some level. The ritemaster calls out, draws, paints, or otherwise creates a representation of the interconnectedness of all life, spiritual and physical, in the region where he works. He may roleplay this according to the Storyteller's will. Wyrm entities must be prevented from subverting the process and balanced with spirits of the Weaver and Wyld. System: The ritemaster must sacrifice a permanent point of Gnosis and make the roll as usual. The result is a state of balance and a stable 'food web' of humans, animals and spirits, enduring for as many full moons as the ritemaster has successes. For example, a battle-spirit which had been inspiring gang attacks might instead draw potential gang members to violent sports with brotherhood and community, or a lust-spirit which had made men visit prostitutes might be redirected to make their wives and partners more attractive to them. The rite can be renewed as often as desired.",

Through the Rite of the Signpost, a ritemaster slowly works his way around a stomping ground or urban caern, leaving signs or markings to intimidate, misdirect, or confuse ordinary people from wandering into the bawn. Trash, graffiti, dead animals, and general signs of squalor can all convince the average human that there are some darkened streets you just don't want to go down. Participating Theurges and Galliards stomp about the area as part of this rite. As shameful as it may seem, this also involves marking a few sidewalks and walls with urine and stink. As an added effect to a successful rite, humans may get lost in the area surrounding the warded area, even a few blocks away. Garou must inhabit this area at least overnight; you can't cast this on a random neighborhood just to confuse people. The rite cannot be performed on an area larger than a single building or alleyway. If the warded area ever approaches the size of a city block, the wards will begin to fail. The ward must be renewed each month (for a caern) or each week (for stomping grounds). System: Enacting this rite requires one or more hours of activity, the expenditure of ten Gnosis (any participants may contribute to this total), and a Wits + Rituals roll (difficulty 7). Record the number of successes. A human that consciously decides to go against his better judgment and enter the area must beat the number of successes on a Willpower roll (difficulty 7). This rite cannot be performed on an area where the Gauntlet is higher than 8.",

        "description": "In the ancient days of Greece, any human who wished to consult the Oracle at Delphi was obliged to pay a tax, the 'telono,' which gave him the right to approach the great altar of Apollo to offer sacrifices (boars, goats, or bulls). Having purified herself in the water of the Kastalian Fountain, Pythia bent over the Navel of the Earth (a cave opening), ate a laurel leaf and, inhaling the vapors emitted from the chasm, entered a state of ecstasy, uttering incoherent words. These were then composed into verses by the Priest, while the interpreter endeavored to render some meaning out of the prophecy. The Greeks say that Python, a great snake-spirit and Gaia's son, defended the rent in the earth from which oracles could receive visions of the future; they tell of Apollo's great victory against Python and his prophetic works of later days. Python wasn't truly destroyed, of course; he and his servants walk the tunnels through Gaia's bowels that lead back and forward in history. Loyal and wise Garou can use Python's Trail to walk those same metaphorical tunnels and gain glimpses of the future. Black Furies who use this Rite take on a distant demeanor, and their prophetic utterances obey only dream-logic, not Weaver think. A second Fury must stand by the Mistress of the Rite while she performs the Rite of Python's Trail, to interpret the nearly mad utterances of her sister. System: After an hour of trance, roll Perception + Enigmas (target 8). Gaia's dream-tunnels travel throughout history, through a given character's personal past and future as well as all the ages of Gaia. The Mistress of the Rite might well become overwhelmed by the visions before her: she needs three successes to convey anything sensible from the signs she sees - less than three and the character notices only sensations like pain and joy, color, and extremes of sound. Three successes yield poetic or metaphorical visions of important parts of the character's past or future. Four successes let the Garou explore the timeline of a packmate or loved one; five let her look at the past and future on a larger scale (for their entire pack or tribe, or she may just stare forward to the fires of the Apocalypse). To portray the prophecy correctly, the Priestess must roll Intelligence + Expression, difficulty 8; more successes indicate that more of the Mistress of the Rite's vision is passed on to the pack or sept. The Storyteller is encouraged to use dream-logic or nightmare-logic to fabricate the character's voyages through the past and future as a result of this Gift. It is intended to allow the Storyteller to grant glimpses and hints of things to come without forcing him to caper his storylines around madly to fit an overly literal interpretation of a character's vision.",

The werewolves reserve it for those who kill their own kind without provocation or lawful challenge but rather through cold, calculated murder in order to achieve some aim or goal. For example, a werewolf who kills another to steal a fetish or ascend to power would be a likely candidate to suffer this punishment... if he could be proven guilty. A lesser crime might warrant a Hunt, where the offender may at least redeem herself by dying well; but in the Silver Death, there is no redemption, only further shame and humiliation. Before the assembled werewolves (at least two others) and spirits, the ritemaster recites the crime(s) of the offender. As he does so, all strength drains from the offender's body, so that she may do nothing but cower as one of the Garou (usually the ritemaster, sometimes the murdered one's packmate or Kin) raises the klaive for the deathblow. System: A Charisma + Rituals roll (difficulty 7) is all that is necessary to rob the offender of all strength. The doomed one cannot step sideways or move from her spot. A Willpower roll (difficulty is 4 + ritemaster's successes) is necessary to stand bravely at the end; a failure costs 1 temporary Glory and 2 temporary Honor, while a botch costs twice as much (as the doomed one broke at the end and groveled most pathetically).",

This rite works only against Garou targets; non-Garou do not possess the proper connection to Erebus in the first place.

Upon successful completion of the rite, the ritemaster must then make a Gnosis roll (difficulty of the target's Gnosis).

        "description": "The Rite of the Sparrow is performed when the Garou of a sept or pack wish to provide aid or support to a Garou of their number who is currently on a quest of some sort. The Garou performing the rite can only see his target when the questing Garou is traveling within one of the Umbras or is within sight of water. In order to perform the rite, the ritemaster must dip a small bird's feet (usually a sparrow's) into a mixture of blood and ashes. The ritemaster then dabs some of the same mixture onto the Garou before she embarks on her quest. The ritemaster then settles into a trance from which he can watch the questor's progress. If the questing Garou is injured or is otherwise in need of aid, the ritemaster may draw on his own strength and the strength of any other Garou who have participated in the ritual to aid their companion. This aid can come in the form of healing, Gnosis, or the transfer of an object to the questor. When such help is given, the ritemaster releases the marked sparrow into the air. More than one sparrow may be used during a given rite. System: The rite requires the expenditure of one Gnosis point to create the bond. An additional Gnosis point must be spent whenever any help is granted to the questor. Only one act can be performed per sparrow freed. In addition, any healing done does damage to the ritemaster or another designated ritual participant. Thus, the damage is actually transferred, not healed. The same is true for Gnosis. Additionally, the Garou participating in the rite must have the object they wish to transfer with them. Placing the sparrow on the object initiates its transfer.",

The reason this rite always takes place on the 13th of February is lost even to the Silent Striders, or so they claim. Regardless, Feralia is a solemn and important rite, one that all Striders take part in, save perhaps those deepest in the throes of Harano or under bans of some sort. Even the Eaters of the Dead participate (although their version of the rite may be slightly different; some Striders have reported finding burnt out Painting Stones they believe were used by the Eaters). If members of a Silent Strider sept or pack know of a fellow Strider suffering from Harano, they will normally do all within their power to convince the suffering Garou to participate in the rite, for it has been known to cure the Harano-stricken. Throughout The Dead Time, Silent Striders gather at places across Gaia wherever the objects known as Painting Stones are located. Other tribes are unsure how Silent Striders know where to locate such stones when traveling in a foreign area, but it is rumored that the wandering Striders sniff out the powerful stones in the Penumbra. Painting Stones are not named for any marks they bear throughout the year; the name instead describes part of the Feralia rite. At exactly the middle of the night, the designated ritemaster walks silently up to the Painting Stone and traces the symbol of the Silent Striders on the stone. The tracing may be in mud, berry juice, blood or any other natural substance. As she finishes, the ritemaster quietly names one of the signs of the coming Apocalypse that she has learned during her life, and she then says whether she has seen evidence of this sign since the last Dead Time. In turn, each Strider present paints the symbol and speaks of a sign and returns to her place in the pack. When all have spoken and placed their mark on the Painting Stone, the ritemaster rises and circles the stone three times counterclockwise. She then leaps over the Painting Stone, passing into the Dark Umbra, the Umbra of the dead, at the top of the arc. The other Striders follow in turn. Within the Dark Umbra the Striders are met by members of their departed Kinfolk, who whisper pieces of prophecies and knowledge to their living relations. Throughout this time the Striders run westward, evermoving as they listen to the wisdom of their Kin. It is said that as long as they keep running, they are protected from the wraiths. Should a Strider falter, though, even for an instant, she may become trapped within the Dark Umbra of souls, perhaps forever. The Striders continue running and listening to the whispers until they see a gleaming rock in front of them. Leaping over this new stone, the Garou find themselves at another of the Painting Stones, just as any Garou there are leaping into the Dark Umbra. This unexplained phenomenon can result in an odd sight in the physical world, as one Garou leaps upwards only to have an entirely different Garou complete the leap. The rite sweeps westward with the night until all participants have completed their leaps. The Striders often learn much from their time among the dead; however, the information is always fragmented and unclear, and the Striders spend much time attempting to determine its exact meaning and import. System: The base difficulty for this roll is 7, but there are only a few Painting Stones within the area of a caern, so ritemasters are usually on their own. Failure indicates the ritemaster does not manage to open the gate between the physical world and the Dark Umbra. This results in a loss of Honor (3 points) for the ritemaster. A botch indicates that the ritemaster loses her footing in the Dark Umbra and may well become lost (by failing a second roll).",

Her tribe is unknown, although the Black Furies readily claim Keres as their own. As legend has it, Keres was so fiercely protective of her packmates that when she was trapped in a cave, surrounded by minions of the Wyrm, with only the bodies of her fallen companions for company, Keres consumed them rather than let Wyrm creatures contaminate the noble bodies with their foul touch. Keres then charged into battle. Empowered by the spirits of her companions, she slew nine times nine great Wyrm beasts before she herself fell. Such was Keres' bravery that Gaia allowed her and the collected spirits of her packmates to run together in the Deep Umbra forever as spirit-Furies. To this day, certain Garou mystics report brief encounters with the fiercely beautiful spirit-pack. The Rite of Keres is a solemn event in which the ritemaster leads the Garou in a howling dirge for all those who have died in the service of Gaia. At this time it is considered proper for even the bravest warriors to voice their anguish, loss, and fear, and to take comfort in the companions still alive. The gathered Garou sit in a large circle representing the neverending circle of Gaia's embrace. Each Garou in turn tells a tale of personal grief. As he finishes his story, the Garou flings a physical representation of his fear and grief, known as a Talisman of Keres, into the center of the circle. Before the ceremony, each Garou creates his own talisman out of some form of wood. A Black Fury might carve a representation of herself with a bowed head, while a Silent Strider's talisman might consist of a paper wolf with broken legs. The talisman need be meaningful only to its creator. The ritemaster is the last Garou to spin her tale and cast in her talisman. As she casts in her talisman, she focuses the anguish of the tribe through her body, calling out to the spirit of Keres to consume the talismans and grant strength to the Garou. If the rite succeeds, the Garou will sense the spirit of Keres as she consumes the talismans in a sudden blast of flames. After the talismans are consumed, the Garou each taste the remaining ashes, taking some small part of the strength of Keres into themselves. The ritemaster then leads the Garou in a revel to celebrate the purging of the Wyrm-taint they have cast forth. System: Any Garou participating in a successful Rite of Keres may make a Stamina + Rituals roll (difficulty 7). If successful, the participant receives one permanent point of Willpower for casting forth her inner fears and pain. Failure causes the ritemaster to lose Honor in the eyes of the tribe; a botch may cause Keres to attack the sept instead of the bonfire, for she abides weakness in no Garou.",

Generally, this mark can be the shape of the offender's auspice glyph carved with silver and painted a silvery color. The offender is then splashed with ice-cold water, and exiled for one phase of the moon, starting with his own auspice. From that day to the next moon, the offender believes that all rain that falls on him is liquid silver. The rain actually causes him harm, and he is unable to soak or heal these wounds. The wounds themselves are illusory. If the offender is innocent, he does not take any real damage from this 'silver' rain, only believe that he does, but if guilty he suffers aggravated damage. Assuming he survives, the violator nonetheless suffers terribly. System: The one moon this trial lasts, the suspected criminal cannot replenish his Gnosis. The drops of rain hitting him feel like shards of silver driving into his skin. The 'silver' does one point of aggravated damage per rainfall. The suspected offender can spend Willpower to ignore the illusion for the duration of one scene, but he cannot heal any of the wounds caused by the silver rain until the trial is over.

Failure means that the condemned fought well and is accorded much posthumous Glory, while a botch means that he eluded his Hunters and can live out his life as a Ronin.",

        "description": "The history of a caern is written in its heart. The Trodden Track draws on the spirits to manifest visible and audible echoes of the caern's past. The images of past glories and the sacrifices of those who defended the caern inspire the participants, strengthening their spiritual bond with the sacred site. Only a Garou who knows the caern and its history intimately can perform this rite, which is why the rite was lost to European tribes who took over native caerns. The rite begins with a map drawn of the caern and its surroundings as they appeared when it was first consecrated. The ritemaster places the map in the center of the caern and burns it, symbolizing the passage of time. As the map turns to ash, the other participating Garou growl deep in their throats, a grinding chorus for the ritemaster's litany. The ritemaster recites the history of the caern and its greatest moments, the sonorous speech melding with the growls to disorient listeners, making them more open to the visions of the past. The key visions - always high points in the caern's history, those that would inspire joy and pride - appear hazily around the participants, like reflections in a murky pool. As the rite concludes, those present feel a surge of resolve and can feel their ancestors watching over them. System: The Trodden Track requires an Intelligence + Rituals roll (difficulty of 8); each dot of Ancestors the ritemaster possesses reduces the difficulty by 1. Participants in a successful rite gain an extra dot of Ancestors until the end of the current moon. This bonus applies even to those with a restricted Background for their tribe; the rite calls on ancestral protectors of the caern instead of their own ancestors. Success also reduces the difficulty by one of the next caern rite performed at the caern.",

        "description": "Two enemies agree to meet within the bounds of a neutral caern. A magical circle is inscribed by a neutral ritemaster, surrounding the caern. Once the circle is closed, the foes may neither leave the circle nor fight each other until they have completed their part of the rite - the carving of two sacred knives, from a common piece of ivory tusk or bone. They may bring no tools, but only use the sharpness of their claws. Together, they must crouch and work, side by side like kin, controlling their Rage and their form. The two foes must dedicate themselves without rest, food, or aid, to the creation of their weapon, the instrument of their vengeance. Once a knife is perfected, to the pleasure of Gaia, its edge bursts into an unmistakable glow of cold blue light. The creator of that knife may then attack her foe as she desires. The slower Garou, if she can survive the first blow, may not depart the magic circle or defend herself until her knife is finished and found satisfying to Gaia. Usually, this rite ends with the death of one of the two rivals; because of this, the performing of this rite is naturally discouraged, because any loss of Garou life brings the Apocalypse one step closer. System: For every hour that passes within the circle, each Garou must make a Rage roll of increasing difficulty, beginning at 4. They each must also roll Crafts + Ritual against each other, to indicate how well the knife is being carved. If either opponent should fall into frenzy before completing her task, the rite is considered to have been violated. The ritemaster may then either dissolve the boundary circle, allowing external interference or aid, or she may keep the circle closed and simply allow the non-frenzied Garou to fight back in her own defense, without finishing the carving of the knife. As in all duels, the ritemaster is considered to be the Master of the Challenge. Any Garou that is wounded must make a check not to frenzy. If the latter situation is chosen, it's considered proper for the victor to finish carving her knife in thanks to Gaia, after her foe has been defeated. If the ritemaster wishes, additional Renown may be awarded to the victor, depending on the beauty or quality of the knife, which then is usually worn openly with pride. The knife thereafter is ready to be enchanted as a fetish, with a particular affinity for spirits with high Rage.",

Every bulldozer was factory-made from iron ore; each vibra-lounger comes from wood and fiber of Gaia. This more specialized version of the Rite of Spirit Awakening awakens the Wyld within any machine, stirring it to behave in ways no ordinary machine-spirit would dream of. System: The Garou must howl and dance wildly to awaken the spirit, rolling Expression + Rituals. In some cases, such as a crazy pagan's motorcycle or a lathe used by generations of blacksmith Kin, the machine is already a little bit wild, and the difficulty will be 6. For machines used by unthinking humans, it's 8, and for machines of the Wyrm (such as a Black Spiral's torture chair) it is 10. With one success, the machine will work normally but will aid the Garou. This might include an enemy's car agreeing to stop (although it's hard to perform this rite for the requisite ten minutes during a car chase). Three successes cause the machine to act abnormally: radios might bring oracular messages or the voices of ancestors, and vending machines turn out to have surprising contents such as boiled skulls, useful business cards or taser refills. Five successes mean that the machine will acquire mobility and a touch of wit. The Garou who scores seven successes can ask the machine to follow her into any danger (it can also speak), and further successes lead to machines shape-shifting, acquiring bizarre abilities and signs of ego. This rite can lead to stories as strange and unpredictable as the Wyld itself, and even seemingly mundane devices bring awe and glory for the storm.",

Each success enables the ritemaster (or the caern Warder) to ask one question regarding a defined area. The difficulty varies with the size of the area.

        "description": "It's said that Grandfather Thunder himself taught this rite to his favorite tribe, the Shadow Lords. This rite brings down terrible storms, full of driving rain and gale strength winds, against the enemies of their sept. Allegedly, other tribes have learned similar rites, including a Silver Fang rite which summons blizzards and snowstorms. The ferocity of the storms depends on the skill of the ritemaster and the natural weather conditions. These storms are not gentle and may last for days; in the crags of the Carpathians, their ferocity is as though Gaia herself lashes out in fury. The tempest may destroy poorly constructed homes. It can also wash out roads, and lightning strikes may start wildfires. The eye of the storm centers on the caern, which suffers little effect from the raging weather. A sept that performs this powerful rite frivolously or often typically finds itself the target of angry Storm-spirits. The rite itself involves chanting and dancing, to the sound of pounding drums which imitate and invoke the thunder. During the performance, the participants splash water liberally to represent rain, and loose long howls to call the wind. Some groups even invoke the names of powerful Incarna, such as Thor, Perun or Jupiter, to help bring the storm. System: The ritemaster must roll Charisma + Rituals to invoke this rite. The difficulty depends on the caern rating; subtract the strength of the caern from 10 to determine the base difficulty. In order to perform this rite, the ritemaster must also spend a point of Gnosis to gain the attention of the Storm-spirits. A single success may bring distant thunder, fog and a light rain. Three successes will generate a powerful storm for a few days. Five or more successes generate terrible weather, which may spawn other, natural, storms in the surrounding countryside.",

The offense does not have to be against the Garou per se, but it may be any act against Gaia or Her children. This rite drops the Veil, forcing a human to see and remember the Garou for the duration of an all-night hunt. The ritemaster leaves a small bag of burning dung and herbs near the sleeping victim. When the victim awakens, the Veil has been burned away from his mind. The following hunt may or may not end in the human's death. Those humans left alive are often rendered insane, their unprepared minds unable to accept the truth revealed by the rite. Some few, however, overcome their fear and heal. This rite is not considered a breach of the Litany. System: The ritemaster must place the specially prepared bag of dung and herbs within 10 feet of where the victim sleeps. The bag smolders when the ritemaster performs the rite. The ritemaster does not need to be near the bag to enact the rite. Failure leaves the Veil intact.

        "description": "When the Garou feel that human expansion threatens an area of the wilds, they may perform the Rite of the Wilderness. If this rite is successful, the spirits of the land will resist any attempts by humans to settle the area. Small animals steal food, gnaw through rope and leather, and do their best to annoy travelers or home-builders. Larger animals, such as bears and wolves, attack horses or even people in order to drive off the humans. Springs and wells become fouled with algae if humans use them as a water supply for more than a day. The wood itself radiates an aura of gloom, with the trees casting strange shadows and rustling in frightening ways. Most superstitious inhabitants of the Dark Ages will avoid a place where the Rite of the Wilderness has been performed. Unfortunately, stories of a haunted wood may well draw the attention of the Church or Infernalists seeking a base of operations. System: The ritemaster must possess an item of nature untouched by humanity. The participants in the rite gather for three nights in the area calling on the spirits of nature to defend themselves. Once this rite is completed, the effects last for a full year if they are not countered by magicks or True Faith. Obviously, if the forest is destroyed, the spirits may not protect it. The area protected and the degree to which the wilderness comes awake depend on the Storyteller's discretion. This ritual may not be cast over the entirety of the Black Forest, for example. If a caern lies within five miles of the location, the difficulty of the rite is reduced by 1. Tribal totems may play a role in this rite, leaving a protected area with the 'signature' of a certain tribe, such as ravenous wolf packs unafraid of fire in the case of Red Talons.",

        "description": "The Warpath have preserved this method of hunting seals and put it to a unique use. The idlak, a tool used by arctic Kinfolk for many years, is created out of a delicate feather tied to a long thin sliver of wood or bone. A hunter sticks this tool into a breathing hole in the ice; when a seal swims to the hole and surfaces for breath, it makes the idlak flutter and tremble. Similarly, this rite allows a Wendigo to pierce the Gauntlet with a fetish idlak, capturing a friendly spirit or Gaffling inside its slender form. This sets an alarm that makes it unnecessary for a Garou to peek through to the Umbra and thereby leave her Earthly back defenseless. Any Bane, or any other dangerous spirits that belong to the Weaver or the Wyrm, may draw near the idlak's place in the Penumbra without noticing it. If the vile spirits pass too closely, or cross the Gauntlet by Materializing, the Gaffling sends a warning by setting the idlak in motion, both physically and spiritually. When it is triggered, it enables the Garou who planted it to track the spirit's manifestation, or helps her to cross quickly into the Penumbra to follow the spirit's tracks and to engage in battle with it. System: The player spends at least two points of Gnosis when planting the idlak, and then rolls Gnosis + Perception. The number of successes the player rolls, or the number of additional Gnosis points spent, determines any additional Gnosis levels for the Gaffling. The spirit senses any thinning or puncture made in the Gauntlet, or the approach of any Bane or hostile spirit nearby in the Penumbra, and makes the idlak shake visibly in the Realm. It also calls mentally to the Garou who bound it into the idlak, alerting her that danger is near.",

        "name": "Bearing the Caern",
        "rite_type": "Caern",
        "description": "While Black Furies may use the Rite of Caern Building (Werewolf, p. 158), many traditionally prefer this ritual, which ties the opening of a spiritual site in with one of Gaia's other most sacred mysteries. After the Furies discover, cleanse, and purify an appropriate area, they simply wait until an appropriate focus for the ritual is ready. The focus, called Maia during the rite, is a pregnant female who is near to term. She can be human, Garou, or wolf - though a Garou who is heavy with a metis child is an especially inauspicious choice. The woman need not be Kinfolk, but if she is not, she may well suffer the effects of the Delirium if any of the Furies in the rite enter a war-form. In the event that the involved Garou feel that they cannot wait for one of their own (or one of their Kin) to reach term, they may kidnap a likely-seeming human or wolf female to act as Maia. In the End Times, this practice is becoming distressingly common. When Maia is near labor, she is brought to the center of the caern-to-be; female Garou surround her, singing hymns to Gaia. Non-Furies may be present, but they must be female; male metis of other tribes are forbidden, though Fury male metis are allowed. A single Crone may aid the mother during labor, but no other assistance can be given: the Furies present must instead fill their hearts with love for Gaia, beseeching her to take Maia as an inspiration, and create a caern here with the child's birth. Should the rite succeed (see below) it is said that fates of the newborn child and caern are tied for the remainder of the child's life. The newborn is forever after immune to the Delirium, even if she is neither Garou nor Kinfolk. Different septs will treat Maia and the newborn caern-child differently, particularly if the pair is not Kinfolk. Some septs take the child from its mother to raise it in a new 'soul-home,' while others adopt both mother and child as honorary Kinfolk. At least one sept has let mother and child return to their ordinary lives, believing that if the child's fate is tied to the caern's, it is best for the child to live out its true destiny. Even such liberal septs, however, generally set a minor spirit or low-ranked Ragabash to keep an occasional eye on the child and check after his well-being. The circumstances of labor and delivery also hold omens for the caern itself. The most auspicious birth is a healthy and quick one, where a Garou is born to a human Garou Maia is heavy with a metis, the sept of the new caern will need to work hard to receive respect from other Garou. Long, hard labor tends to suggest the influence of the Wyrm near the caern. If Maia dies in giving birth, many Theurges believe that the caern and its Garou will play an important role (for good or ill) in the coming Apocalypse. If the child is stillborn, the rite fails; the death of both Maia and child during the ritual is considered to be a profoundly bad omen for Garou participants. System: As with the Rite of Caern Building, the Mistress of the Rite must make a series of successful Gnosis rolls against a difficulty of 8, and she must achieve a total of 40 successes. She can make this roll twice per hour during Maia's labor, and must succeed before the child is born. For this ritual to succeed, at least ten Garou (one for each moon of pregnancy) must participate, in addition to the Mistress of the Rite, Maia, and the Crone who attends her. A botch here deals seven health levels of damage to all involved in the Rite, including Maia. However, the Crone attending Maia may roll her Gnosis (difficulty 8) to absorb Maia's damage; she can take one wound level onto herself for every success rolled. Unlike the Rite of Caern Building, the Garou present do not have to sacrifice their Gnosis to fuel the new caern; the creation of new life suffices as this spark. If all goes well with Maia, child, and ritual, the new caern has a base Level of 1, with a Gauntlet of 4. Additional successes improve the caern just as with the Rite of Caern Building. Those Garou participating in Bearing the Caern receive Renown as those participating in the Rite of Caern Building; additionally, Maia, if a Garou, receives an additional point of each type of Renown (giving her one Wisdom, six Glory, and four Honor Renown).",

As the name implies, the Mistress of the Rite creates a long-lasting curse that cascades down through generations of the criminal's family. This curse is largely left in the hands of the Mistress of the Rite, though there are some restrictions on it (see below). It does not have a set effect. However, for a ritual of this power, it is important that the subject of the rite be physically present for its casting; no doubt he will have to be bound, since no sane person would knowingly allow himself to be cursed in such a fashion. This rite is reserved for the most heinous of criminals against the laws of Gaia: the rapist, the mass-murderer, the incestuous parent, the cannibal. The Mistress of the Rite chooses four things about the curse: how the curse will pass down the family line, when it takes effect on a particular child, its exact effect, and how the curse may be alleviated: it may pass from parent to all children, and so on down the line; or it may only 'infect' the eldest child, or only males (or only females). It usually does not take effect right from birth - it may wait until puberty, or until marriage, or some other simple condition may bring it about. Accordingly, the curse doesn't generally kill its targets outright - if it did, there would be no future generations to torment. Instead, it makes their lives unpleasant, perhaps eventually unbearable. This could be almost anything: mild schizophrenia; regular bad luck; a plague of ghosts or malevolent minor spirits; inability to hold a regular job; a serious skin condition or non-life-threatening chronic medical condition; or many other things. System: The Fury who performs this ritual must assign a condition to allow its breaking. She cannot break the curse on her own, under any circumstances. She must inform the cursed what the condition is, even if he cannot possibly satisfy it. The condition is often implausible on its surface: 'Your infant child's sixth daughter must marry a Catholic priest.' The condition cannot be impossible, however. Knowledge of the condition does not have to be passed down from parent to child; if the information is lost, the family will be cursed forever. To perform this rite, the subject must be present; the Mistress of the Rite rolls Intelligence + Expression, difficulty 8. She must achieve 3 successes on this roll; additional successes have no other effect. The Fury's player must write down the precise effects of the rite before the roll takes place; if it fails (that is, achieves 2 or fewer successes), the subject of the curse is free to leave the Fury's presence and that particular curse cannot be used on him in the future. If the roll botches, the Fury who performs the rite has the curse afflicted upon her and her descendants, and the subject of the curse is forever immune to cursing rituals performed by this Fury.",

The ritemaster must lead a group of Garou (and often Kin) in three days of chanting, dancing and meditating.

        "rite_type": "Death",
        "description": "The martyred hero represents all that is good and righteous to the cause. Unlike the private and intimate Lesser Rite of Mourning, the Greater Rite of Mourning is an elaborate and formal event dedicated to full-scale hero worship. There must be at least 10 participants in addition to the ritemaster. The Greater Rite of Mourning serves a dual purpose. First of all, it empowers the chosen cause of the ritemaster and the participants, strengthening their resolve and ability to succeed in their struggle. Second, it bestows great posthumous renown to the honored, strengthening his or her memory and spiritual essence. As with the lesser version of this rite, the honoree may appear or even become an ancestor-spirit as a result of the worship given during this ritual. Due to the great power of such a rite if well performed, and the difficulty in assembling such large numbers of participants, rites like these are not common except during times of great struggle. The Greater Rite of Mourning is performed only once. The rite usually commences with the calling to order by the ritemaster. This is followed by a chanting recital of the fundamentals of the honored hero's career, struggle, and death, and its relevance to the struggle at hand. Following is a moment of silent meditation in honor of the deceased. The ritemaster then declares the different virtues of the hero, while offering symbolic sacrifices in the deceased's name. This leads into a common chant, where the ritemaster leads the participants in calling to the hero to bless them with his virtues and aid them in finishing his noble struggle. At this point, the deceased may or may not appear as an apparition in order to bless them in person. The song flows naturally into a chanting 'war speech' by the ritemaster, restating the purpose of their gathering and the necessity of their noble struggle. If delivered properly, the speech whips the participants into a proper mood, and many a Greater Rite of Mourning has been followed by a bloody and heroic attack against the enemies of the People. System: The ritemaster, who must be of a rank at least equal to the number of participants divided by 10, makes a Charisma + Rituals roll, difficulty 10 minus the rank of the honored hero. The difficulty further decreases by one for every 10 participants. One success has no other effect than an Honor point to all involved. Two successes grant the honored hero a point of Renown for each 10 participants, plus an additional number of Renown equal to the ritemaster's rank, to be distributed to the categories the hero was honored for. The participants all regain lost Willpower, as well as a point of spent Rage or Gnosis (depending on the purpose of the rite), and gain two points of honor each. The ritemaster also receives a number of Honor points equal to the rank of the honored hero. Three successes grant three points of Honor to all participants, except for the ritemaster, who receives Renown equal to the rank of the honoree, plus a tenth of the total number of participants. All participants also gain the use of one of the hero's abilities or Gifts for the struggle at hand. The hero being honored receives a point of Renown for every five participants, in addition to the points gained from the ritemaster's rank. Four or five successes result in the participants gaining the use of two of the abilities or Gifts of the honored hero, and each participant regains two points of Rage or Gnosis, or one of each. The ritemaster gains the use of an additional Gift. The hero has a 50% chance of actually appearing as an apparition and gains the ritemaster's rank plus one for every five participants in Renown.

        "description": "From time out of mind, one of the worst nightmares for a Garou was for one of her Kinfolk to be possessed by a Bane. Taint could be cleansed, but the Wyrm-spirit joined body and soul too thoroughly to extricate without destroying the host: even with a powerful healer at the ready, an exorcism frequently left the host shattered in mind and spirit. Worse still, the Bane often escaped into the Umbra to possess again another day. More often than not, Garou saw killing the victim as an agonizing but necessary task. Recently, an Uktena pack returned from a decade-long quest with a ritual that offers a (slightly) better chance to both destroy the spirit and preserve the patient. Rather than ripping the Bane from the body, the rite drains its energy until it shrivels and pulls away like a withered creeper vine. So far, the pack's sept has kept the Rite quiet as they perfect their practice of it. Several fomori have been cured, but many more have died; two Garou nearly died in the process. Soon, though, they will present it to the Grand Council. It is hoped that the rite will disseminate throughout the tribe, and as word spreads the Garou Nation will have a newfound respect for the dark questers of the Pure Lands. System: The fomor is usually bound and rendered generally powerless, but state of consciousness is irrelevant. The chants that open the rite ensure the Bane is locked within the body - for better or worse. Other werewolves may assist the ritemaster, but all must be consecrated to the purpose beforehand by undergoing a purification ritual. The ritemaster spends a Gnosis point; the player rolls Wits + Rituals (difficulty is the Bane's Willpower), adding one die for every additional Gnosis point spent (other participants may contribute). Successes count against the Bane's Essence; when Essence reaches zero, the Bane falls into Slumber. Seen from the Umbra, the shriveled Bane is draped around the victim and may be pulled off and destroyed. A new roll can be attempted every hour with an additional expenditure of Gnosis, but the ritual is exhausting for all participants (See sidebar). A very powerful Bane can take hours or even days to defeat. Unfortunately, the host may not be able to stand the strain. The Bane fights back if it can. If it is unable to do so, it tears the victim apart, doing three levels of aggravated damage, minus successes for that hour (in other words, if the ritemaster gets two successes, the victim takes one health level of damage). On a botch, the Bane can make a break for it, doing its Rage in unsoakable aggravated damage on its way out. Damage may be healed by a Gift, assuming the healer can touch the subject. Afterward, the ritual area and all participants are tainted by the corrupt Essence that hemorrhaged from the Bane during the rite, and all must be thoroughly cleansed through a purification ritual.",

        "description": "One of the Uktena's most important self-appointed tasks is the capture and binding of powerful Banes that, for whatever reason, cannot be destroyed. The Uktena performing this rite consider it one of the most sacred and dangerous of all their mystical duties; they know the chances are great that many will die in completing the ritual, so it is never undertaken without serious forethought. System: The ritemaster begins by leading participants through a ritual chant and dance intended to subdue the Bane. All the werewolves then sacrifice Gnosis (usually many points) so the ritemaster may weave a net of power to contain the Bane; if all Gnosis is expended, then Willpower and finally Stamina is spent to successfully complete the rite. The ritemaster's player then rolls Wits + Rituals, difficulty 9. For every 20 points of combined Gnosis, Willpower and Stamina spent, the difficulty drops by one, to a minimum of difficulty 7. One success is needed to create the cage that holds the Bane; additional successes add to the strength of the Bane's confinement. Should the ritemaster's player fail the roll, the character remains alive, but the Bane is not contained, and is extremely angry. A botch indicates the immediate and messy death of the ritemaster. All players must also make a roll on their characters' current Stamina. Even one success at the same difficulty indicates they survive, but are likely exhausted. A failure means the werewolf dies from the rigors of participating in the rite. Needless to say, living or dead, participants in this rite deserve a good measure of Renown for their bravery and honor. Note that while this Rite works for many powerful Banes, the greatest spiritual evils (such as the Storm Eater) require still more powerful rites, and the dedication of the individual Bane.",

        "name": "Rite of Caern Building",
        "rite_type": "Caern",
        "description": "This powerful rite actually creates a permanent caern by drawing the spirit world and the physical world closer together. Simply reciting the rite draws the attention of the Wyrm's servitors, and actually performing the rite has been known to prove fatal. Only the most powerful and wise mystics dare lead such an undertaking. A powerful Theurge is almost always selected to perform this most sacred of rites. Many Garou must channel their energy through a powerful leader to have even a hope of success. Whole packs have been known to die in agony of failed attempts. Once the physical focus for the heart of the caern is chosen, the area must be cleansed of all taint in preparation for its transformation. All Garou participating in the rite must undergo a Rite of Cleansing. The ritemaster performs a series of minor rituals, meditation and other physical preliminaries to prepare for her awesome task. The sept must post sentries (very often the players' characters), for servants of the Wyrm almost invariably attempt to disrupt such a great rite. Only the mightiest warriors are chosen for such an assignment, and their protection is critical to the success of the rite. The leader of the rite is helpless while he chants a long litany of verses designed to draw a great spirit into the prepared caern. Although it is possible to create a specific type of caern, most leaders leave this choice to Gaia and accept whatever caern she grants the sept. The rite must be performed between the hours of sunset and sunrise during the waxing of the moon. Only the Black Spiral Dancers create caerns during the moon's waning. System: The rite requires an extended roll of Wits + Rituals, although the leader may use only as many dice as she has Gnosis. The difficulty begins at 8, and it is modified downward by one for every five Garou participating and spending Gnosis over and above the 13 necessary participants, and 40 successes are required. Only one roll can be attempted per hour of the ritual. Because an enormous amount of Gnosis is needed to create a new caern, a minimum of 13 Garou, one for each moon of the year, must participate in this rite. Regardless of the number of Garou aiding her, the ritemaster can channel such a powerful stream of Gnosis through her system only once per hour. The rite must be performed at night. Therefore, the ritemaster has only eight rolls (one per hour) in which to accomplish her task in most places and at most times of the year. This limit makes success fairly unlikely. If indeed, the rite does fail, all involved suffer five wounds. These wounds are not aggravated, but they are very painful, and they always leave small teardrop-shaped scars scattered across the Garou's body. Such scars are considered marks of bravery, and these tears of Gaia are often highlighted by tattoos or paint and worn with pride by the Garou. The Garou say the scars are the result of Gaia crying out for her children's pain. Once the leader scores the required number of successes, all those involved in the rite must contribute Gnosis points - 100 are needed. If the total Gnosis available is not 100, all those participating begin to suffer aggravated wounds. Each wound counts as three more Gnosis points toward the total. Botches during this rite are particularly deadly. All characters involved suffer seven health levels of damage, which means that even a Garou previously at full health becomes Incapacitated. Those Garou reduced to below Incapacitated suffer severe Battle Scars (see pp. 189-190). If the minimum number of successes is rolled (40), the caern is ranked Level One. The Gauntlet of such an area is 4, and the spirits bound into the caern will grant powers approximately equal to Level One Gifts. Every five additional successes raise the level of the caern by one, correspondingly raising the magnitude of the powers the caern grants. At Level Three, the Gauntlet of the area is 3, while at Level Five, it is but 2. Immediately upon the rite's successful completion, the ritemaster must sacrifice a number of permanent Gnosis points equal to the level of the caern. If a player's character should somehow assume the role of ritemaster and succeed, she receives three points of Glory Renown, five points of Honor Renown and seven points of Wisdom Renown. Anyone else participating in the rite receives five points of Glory Renown and three points of Honor Renown. This task is a legendary one that deserves a suitable reward.",

The rite was more popular in olden times, but in these days, the Get of Fenris don't have the numbers to permit many lethal challenges for the post of Jarl. The rite acknowledges the history of both the fallen sept leader and the new Jarl. The ritemaster guides the new Jarl through the steps of establishing his new rank. The new Jarl must devour the heart of his predecessor, thus symbolically gaining the wisdom to rule his sept properly. The fallen leader's possessions are turned over to the new Jarl in accordance with the Litany, but relatives with a claim on weapons or fetishes are allowed to challenge the new Jarl for their possession. System: Standard roll. If successful, the new Jarl gains instant knowledge of one of the fallen leader's Gifts (Storyteller's choice; higher-level Gifts are more likely, even if the new Jarl is still not yet of the rank to use them).",

        "description": "More celebratory than it might seem from the name, the Rite of Conquest is performed to welcome back a Bringer of Light who has successfully endured an extended stay in the presence of the Wyrm (and emerged unscathed, both physically and spiritually). It is similar in many respects to a Rite of Cleansing, but it is far more powerful. Recipients of this rite are true paragons among the Garou, and even Garou of other tribes bow down before them in respect, as they have accomplished things few others would even dare to attempt. This rite may only be performed by one who has himself received the rite, and it is only performed under a sky filled with storm clouds, under Grandfather Thunder's watchful gaze. System: To receive this rite, a Shadow Lord - typically a Bringer of Light - must endure the horrors of the Wyrm for a period of no less than six months. He must interact with fomori, Banes, or corrupted Garou during this period, and he must successfully resist their influence without falling to the Wyrm, or even being tainted by its presence. If the Garou survives such an ordeal, he may receive this rite and be recognized as one of the strongest of Gaia's warriors. Truly, he has conquered the Wyrm. The Garou performing this rite, who must be a Theurge, expends a number of Gnosis points equal to the recipient Garou's rank. The recipient pours forth all of his Gnosis points, giving them up to the storms above him. Once this is done, the ritemaster makes a Charisma + Rituals roll (difficulty 10 - the target Garou's Rank) and draws the power of Gaia into the recipient's body. On receiving the rite, the recipient gains one of several possible benefits (player's choice). Possible benefits are as follows: • The recipient becomes highly resistant to the thrall of the Wyrm. He must roll eight or more successes on a Rage roll to enter a frenzy, and 10 or more successes to enter the Thrall of the Wyrm. Further, the character may spend a Willpower point to halt the frenzy normally, even if he would normally fall into the Thrall of the Wyrm. • The Lightbringer becomes highly resistant to Wyrm toxins. He receives no penalty from supernatural radiation, balefire, Wyrm elementals, and the like (although he does still suffer damage from such attacks). He is likewise immune to Bane possession. • The character is immune to Harano. • The character's sanity is absolute. He becomes immune to any and all circumstances that might inflict him with temporary or permanent insanity, and will maintain his sanity even if forced to dance the Black Spiral (although he is not protected from any other aspect of this gruesome ritual).",

        "rite_type": "Mystic",
        "description": "This extremely powerful rite has only recently been rediscovered and is currently known only to one sept of Red Talons, the Sept of the First Rage (see the Appendix). Gaia's Rebirth allows the ritemaster to sacrifice her own Gnosis, and, if necessary, her own life to reclaim Gaia's pure form from human defilement. The form of such corruption does not matter - the rite would work just as well destroying a path through a state park as it would leveling a building in a major city. The end result is the same: The land returns to the state it would be in had humans never seen it. Trees push their way through concrete, cars are covered and crushed by moss or overgrown with moss, although any organic matter (such as corpses) is consumed at the normal rate. Performing this rite is complex. It requires a precise sense of timing, and the ritemaster must be guided by nothing but instinct. If she begins the rite even one minute too early or too late, the rite will fail, but the energies released may well destroy her. Gaia's Rebirth can only be performed on the last night of the waning crescent moon, the night before the start of the Ragabash cycle. The climax must occur between the setting of the moon and rising of the sun, and the rite must be performed at the site to be purified (meaning a Red Talon cannot perform the rite outside city limits and expect the city itself to be consumed). Isn't This a Bit Overpowered? So, what's to stop a player from building a Red Talon character with 5 dots of Rituals, a lot of Ancestors and Pure Breed, and Gnosis 10, and performing this rite in, say, downtown Detroit? Well, the Storyteller, for starters. The Rite of Gaia's Rebirth is meant to be a world-altering phenomenon. Currently, only one Garou in the entire world knows the rite, and he is very particular about whom he teaches. Even learning of the rite's existence should take several stories, and learning it surely enough to use it might take an entire chronicle. Using this rite in an urban environment should meet all sorts of opposition, from servants of the Wyrm and the Weaver to other Garou (the Glass Walkers might not take kindly to an entire city being destroyed), to vampires, to any other beings who might be offended by this kind of disruption. The would-be ritemaster herself should encounter some pretty serious decisions about whether or not the long-term consequences of this rite would be worth the short-term satisfaction of the devastation it would cause. And above all, the Storyteller should consider how disruptive it would be to the chronicle. Again, as a climax to a long-running chronicle, successful use of this rite would be superb. As a casual manner to cause some chaos, we don't recommend it. Garou are capable of causing chaos without any rites at all.",

        "description": "This is one of the few ceremonies that Wendigo hide from their Kinfolk, and it is never undertaken lightly. Galliards say that the rite has been passed down through the generations, from Grandmother Luna, for Garou alone, so that they may speak to Luna in times of need. When great trials and questions plague the tribe, the Elders meet in council and choose a Theurge to lead a moon dance. A sacred vessel is crafted in a fashion befitting the nature of the question, and purified in preparation to contain a great spirit. The Theurge and a chosen pack of dancers begin the dance by passing into the Umbra and choosing a moon path to follow. As they run down the path, they howl and sing of the troubles of their people, letting their cries for help echo through the Umbra. If Luna favors their prayers and judges that her aid is needed, she sends a Lune to appear and test their strength. The Theurge chosen to lead the rite must then count coup on the spirit, using the ritually-prepared vessel in place of the customary wand. The Theurge and the Lune test their wills against each other. The longer the battle, the more pleased Luna is, and the more auspicious the answer received. Should the Theurge overcome the Lune spirit, it submits utterly and passes into the vessel, where it remains until the next spring, when the fetish shatters with the first cracking of the ice. Should the Lune overcome the Theurge instead, the Lune escapes, and the Theurge's spirit is bound inside the vessel to dwell there so long as it remains whole. The vessel, upon first being lifted, speaks whatever answer Luna has seen fit to grant, directly into the heart of the holder. System: This rite is performed similarly to the Rite of Counting Coup and the Rite of the Moon Dance; the Theurge ritemaster must roll Charisma + Rituals at a difficulty determined by the Willpower (8) + Rage of the summoned Lune. A Theurge that completes this rite earns a point of Renown for every success she rolls past the Lune's Willpower + Rage. This rite may take place at any time during the lunar cycle, but the Elders must determine the time, depending on the talent of their Theurge and the seriousness of the trouble. If the rite is performed during the new moon, the Lune puts up less of a fight, and is most easily subdued, ensuring the success of the ceremony and a solution, although it is not Luna's most powerful or pleasant answer. Conversely, at the full moon, Luna herself can exert more of her energy and good will to aid the Wendigo with their problem, and the Lune will similarly be at its strongest and most difficult to defeat.",

The ritemaster enacts the help of a pack to slowly working their way around the bawn of a caern. By scratching on trees and stones, marking locations with urine and scent, calling on the steadfast power of the Earth and even hanging faded 'BEWARE OF DOGS' and 'TRESPASSERS WILL BE SHOT' signs, they actively discourage humans from finding their way into the heart of the caern. This doesn't act like an absolute 'Ward Against Humans.' Humans can still uncover the caern if its inhabitants aren't careful, but the rite forces them to take a bit of effort to actually work their way to a caern's spiritual center. System: The system is much the same as that of the Rite of the Signpost, even to requiring the expenditure of ten Gnosis. Only one ritemaster makes the final Wits + Rituals roll, but any participating Garou may spend one Willpower to grant an automatic success to the roll. Anyone within the bawn of a caern who passes the Caern Ward must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6); if he can't score as many successes as the Garou did on this rite, he gets lost and cannot find his way to the spiritual heart of the caern. If he succeeds, he can only find it by searching the area - an activity that's sure to draw the attention of nearby Garou.

        "description": "These days, Stargazer caerns are particularly vulnerable places. There is, however, a rather perilous Stargazer rite that some have learned in case their caern is threatened and beyond the ability of the guardians to protect it. With this rite, a Stargazer may take the powerful heart of the caern into her own heart and secret it away from the place so its power may be planted anew, or at least added to the strength of an already existing caern. In performing the rite, a single Stargazer must first successfully perform the Rite of the Opened Caern. Once this is complete, the werewolf must then consume some part of the land surrounding the caern - this may be soil from the ground, water from a lake, or even pieces of brick or concrete if it's an urban caern. Finally, the Stargazer must plead with the totem spirit of the caern, begging and cajoling until finally the caern heart is relinquished for a time, taken deep into the Stargazer's own still-beating organ. But this rite carries with it an exhausting price; the Stargazer who takes this burden unto herself will die soon after performing the rite, as her flesh is simply too frail to handle the potent energies that accompany a caern's own spirit. Her time to affix the caern's heart back to the flesh of the Emerald Mother is severely limited. Knowledge of this rite is exceedingly rare. System: As directed, the Stargazer must first successfully open the caern using the Rite of the Opened Caern. After consuming some part of the caern, the player must roll for the Stargazer to engage in a contest of pleas and supplications versus the caern's totem spirit. The player rolls the ritemaster's Charisma + Performance, with a difficulty of the caern's rating + 4. Even a single success allows the caern heart to be 'carried' by the Stargazer, but every success increases the time the Stargazer may 'carry' the caern with her. One success allows the Stargazer to hold the caern spirit within for a number of hours equal to 10 minus the caern's rating. Every success beyond the first on the roll allows for one full day to be added onto the time allowed. If the Stargazer attempts to keep the caern within past this 'time limit,' she takes one unsoakable aggravated level of damage per hour until she dies. If the Stargazer dies, the caern dies and cannot be recovered. 'Dropping' the caern heart into a new location requires that a number of permanent Gnosis points be spent equal to the caern's rating. If the Stargazer does not have the requisite Gnosis to spend, she may take two aggravated levels per one Gnosis point missing. She must still spend at least one permanent Gnosis point in this manner, however, or the caern is not re-anchored to a new location. At any time during the 'carrying' of the caern's heart, the Stargazer may simply reject the caern spirit and eject it from her form without any roll or Gnosis expenditure - but this unequivocally destroys the caern, and it may never return.",

Most Garou frown on using this rite in all but the direst emergencies, for it is quite destructive to the land it scours clean. The counter-argument is that Gaia is resilient, and it is better to let Her heal Her wounds than suffer in the coils of the Wyrm. Even so, the questions raised by the rite ensure that the Rite of the Hurricane remains a last resort, to be used only when the need is dire. System: This rite may only be performed in a tropical area, and even then only during the storm season. If these conditions are met, a single day is enough to call up a storm cell in the general region. Manifesting hurricane-force winds for a single scene is easily done, but maintaining the storm is another matter. Doing so requires the expenditure of three points of Gnosis per day, which may be paid by any number of willing participants. Once the cost is not paid, the storm dissipates normally.",

The person on whom the rite is performed thus becomes Kinfolk. Two Children unrelated to the human must witness that he loves Gaia and would aid the Children's cause. Most often this rite is done for mates of Garou or Kin. Some of the Patient Deed say that they hope to extend the rite to whole nations. The rite consists of the Garou dancing round the subject, while the ritemaster chants from the Songs of Welcome. As the rite progresses, the Garou slowly shapeshift, until finally they assume the Crinos form without frightening the human. System: The ritemaster makes an extended Wits + Rituals roll, difficulty of the human's Willpower. He must accumulate successes equal to the human's age before the rite succeeds; children are easier to adopt than adults.",

The Caller of the Wyld then starts a howl that the other elders then join in, auspice by auspice. All of them are beseeching Phoenix to attend the gathering and choose the werewolves he deems to be worthy. As the rite draws to an end, a column of cold, icy blue fire should appear in front of the candidates. They then walk through the fire one by one, with Phoenix's mark, an icy blue flame on their left shoulder blade, appearing on those the totem deems worthy. When Phoenix has made his choice - on occasions before all the candidates have walked through the fire - the flame draws inwards into a tight pillar which then ascends sedately into the sky, to hang above the caern for anything from a few minutes to an hour or so. The longer Phoenix remains, the better the omen for the success of the Silver Pack. System: The ritemaster rolls Wits + Rituals (difficulty 7). If the roll succeeds, the column appears as described above. Those chosen members of the Silver Pack are picked at the Storyteller's discretion. Successful members pass through the flame unharmed. Failed candidates suffer a single level of aggravated damage. Truly unworthy candidates - Litany breakers, would-be traitors, or those with a guilty secret - can suffer up to four levels of aggravated damage. Phoenix does not take kindly to his time being wasted with unworthy candidates. If the rite is attempted without representatives of all five auspices being present, the ritemaster will suffer five levels of aggravated damage when the fire materializes around him and then dissipates.",

        "description": "This rarest of ceremonies is performed in order to absolve a cannibal Garou of their sin and remove the taint of their actions, at the cost of all their Rank and Renown. Because of the difficulty in completing this rite, and the ghastly nature of the situation itself, it is seldom finished, always performed in utter secrecy, and even more seldom discussed. Many ritemasters have argued that the risk of redeeming a cannibal can never be outweighed by the cannibal's usefulness to the pack or tribe. It is generally decided, in a secret Council of the Second Birth, that the Garou in question possesses an ability or asset that is absolutely vital to the survival of the tribe. Only when this Council has come to this conclusion will the rite be prepared. The details of the rite itself are simple in contrast to the politics surrounding it. At the full moon, the cannibal Garou is brought blindfolded, bound, and gagged, to the center of a concealed earthen circle. If the circle is discovered by anyone outside the rite's council, the area is considered polluted and the rite fails. This ritual area must have been purified and consecrated to Gaia nightly over the course of one entire lunar month, using the Rite of Cleansing, the smoke of burnt birch or willow branches, and copious amounts of blood from two different ritemasters. One of the ritemasters howls the transgressions of the cannibal Garou in a Curse of Ignominy, standing at the westernmost point of the circle, reviling the villain's deeds with discordant disdain. Simultaneously, the other ritemaster performs a Howl of Introduction from the easternmost point, reciting the new identity that the Garou will assume, assigning all the committed sins to the previous, vile persona. Both howls must end precisely at the same time. At this moment, the target of the rite, for all intents and purposes, has his Wyrm taint torn out by the hand of Gaia. Note that this taint remains a coherent spirit-thing in the nearby Umbra: it may evaporate, manifest as a spirit of some kind, or affix itself to another target, as befits the Storyteller's needs. Whether or not this reborn Garou (always an Ahroun) still possesses the very powers and Gifts that made him so valuable is an entirely different risk undertaken by the Council.",

Because of Sutekh's curse on the tribe, a Seeker wishing to bring one of his tribemates back from the dead must act quickly (the rite must begin before the body cools, as a guideline), before the spirit is irretrievably lost. This ritual has not yet been performed on a Garou from another tribe since its rediscovery, but Seekers theorize that any complete body will do. This ritual is not without cost to its dead subject: Nothing that has died may dwell in the land of the living. The re-vivified werewolf must enter the Umbra (or the Dark Umbra), never to return to the physical world. Eventually, the Garou will disconnect and become a spirit-like creature. The Seekers argue amongst themselves about the ritual's possible effects on normal humans, and even on vampires, but for now they are proceeding with further research and extreme caution. System: In a lengthy ritual abundant with Egyptian symbology and ceremonial tools, the ritemaster and his assistants repair, clean the body inside and out, and embalm it. The player rolls Intelligence + Rituals against a difficulty of 10 for Silent Striders (reflecting the hurry with which the ritual must be performed), or 8 for Garou; other beings may be harder or easier to call back from the dead. Success indicates that the spirit returns to the body, and that the revived Garou must immediately step sideways into the Umbra. If the revived Garou enters the physical world again, he immediately loses three health levels per turn until he returns to the Umbra or dies; this damage is aggravated. Failure indicates either a mistake by the ritemaster, or that the spirit simply refuses to return. The results of a botch are left entirely to the Storyteller, who should feel free to wreak all kinds of havoc on those who mess with the powers of life and death.",

Since the totem of Yellow Fang's pack was Wisagatcaq, the ritemaster added the bones of a jaybird's wings. Then he bound the pile of bones together, with sinew and fresh intestines, tying knots in an order I didn't understand, singing in a language none of us knew. He laid the entire thing onto the whole skin of a wolf that'd died of natural causes, and sewed the wolf skin shut with a needle of bone. With his bare hands, he dug a grave into the earth of the caern, which scared the piss out of anyone who hadn't already wet themselves. And then he just... threw the bundle into it. The rest of us put a rock on top of the grave and said Yellow Fang's name. We covered it up fast. Nobody wanted to see the empty wolf skin, lying there in the ground. 'The wrath of Great Wendigo rose, then. I could barely believe what I was seeing. I saw the curling of ice-smoke seeping out of the jumble of rocks, making the bloody heap underneath twitch, shudder, and finally crawl to its feet. With a horrifying, halting jerk, the thing awoke - its skin was lurching and shuddering around, but I could tell the bones inside it were knitting together somehow. The abomination scrabbled to get its balance and then started off southward, unstoppably plowing through the snow, leaving an incredibly corrupt stench in its wake. I think we all threw up then, even the ritemaster. The Tupilaq was on the Hunt. 'Two days later, Jini Grey-Cloud found what was left of Yellow Fang, outside the cave where he had been hiding. The Tupilaq must have dragged him out. Jini never could bring herself to tell me what she saw. She told us she left him there for the crows.' - from the writings of Theodore Sha-wun-uk, Wendigo wildlife conservationist System: The ritemaster must ascertain, through the successful completion of another Rite of Punishment of lower level, that the traitor Garou is worthy of death. Because of the horrible nature of this rite, it is generally reserved only for those who commit the worst offenses, such as eating the flesh of humans or wolves, openly ignoring an honorable surrender, or Damaging or destroying a caern. The Tupilaq is summoned by assembling a group of accusers, each of whom offer their own knowledge of the traitor's transgressions during the rite, either aloud or silently. The ritemaster must make a Charisma + Rituals roll, as usual, and all other participants in the rite must spend a point of Gnosis to contribute to the rite.

When this rite is performed a Garou is cast out utterly from the Garou; declared an agent of the Wyrm. This casting out reaches even into the Umbra, expunging the victim's soul from the ranks of the Garou. The Theurges say this means that in his next life, if he even has one, the former Garou will return as a creature of the Wyrm. No vestige of honor is possible for such a lost soul. This rite is performed for only those Garou who are found to be the most heinous traitors to the Litany, the Garou, and even Gaia herself. During the rite, all items connected to the traitor are destroyed in an intense fire. If the traitorous Garou has been found and killed, his body is also burned. Next, the most powerful mystics present stand over the dying fire and form a bridge into the deepest Umbra. Spirits are called to pass word of the Garou's disgrace throughout the Tellurian as the Theurges cry tears of grief onto the ashes of hope beneath them. During the final stage of the long rite, the traitor's pack-brothers take the bundle of ashes to the most barren site available. There the ashes are dumped onto earth free of any life.

In essence, it is much like the Rite of Binding; the weapon in question becomes a one-shot talen of great power. System: The ritemaster must successfully convince some sort of firebird or apocalyptic spirit to imbue the weapon; he then rolls Wits + Rituals (difficulty 8) and spends two Gnosis points. Success imbues the weapon with tremendous power for the span of a single day or until used. The weapon must be thrown or fired while the Garou shouts a word of power. The weapon may hit any target as usual, at any range. The shot, spear, etc., does not stop, but continues in a straight line ad infinitum. For each multiple of its own range (two times, three times, and so on) that it goes, it adds one die of damage to its dice pool. Thus, a burst from an assault rifle, with a range of 120 yards, would inflict three additional dice at 350 yards. As the shots go on and on, they become more and more powerful. This power does nothing for increasing a weapon's utility at long range (the difficulty to hit is not reduced), but that isn't the aim of the rite. Weapons imbued with this power are meant to be fired into the hordes of the Wyrm, hitting harder the farther into the ranks they penetrate.

The weapon must be fashioned over the course of a complete cycle of the moon (one month) while concentrating upon the one it is intended to slay. The weapon must either incorporate some object previously taken from the foe or a drop of blood and the tears of the maker brought forth under the full moon. During the rite proper, the Garou calls forth a spirit of vengeance, which enters the weapon, which becomes imbued with the power to slay the one who truly wronged him. A deserving enemy is struck down by even the slightest blow or scratch, but, if the foe has not truly harmed the Garou, the weapon inflicts only normal damage. System: Creating the weapon of vengeance requires the Garou to spend one point of Gnosis and make a Dexterity + Crafts roll (difficulty 7). During the month in which the weapon is constructed, the Garou can do nothing else strenuous that takes him away from the caern, nor can he leave his work to return later. If the attempt to create the weapon fails, another month must be spent to repeat the crafting. The rite itself is performed once the weapon is completed. The weapon itself inflicts ten health levels of aggravated damage, but only against the intended target. Once the weapon has struck the Garou's enemy, it shatters, wounding the slayer for two aggravated health levels as he has allowed vengeance to so rule his path.

        "name": "Rite of Spirit Union",
        "rite_type": "Mystic",
        "description": "This ancient rite was lost to time for centuries before it was rediscovered recently by a pack that ventured far into the Deep Umbra on a quest to find allies in their fight. Once, long ago, brave Garou heroes ready to risk everything to uphold their sacred duty to Gaia made pacts with spirits to merge with them, creating divine warrior beings with a werewolf's mind and prowess, and a spirit's power and nature. The union represents a serious imbalance, however, and is not sustainable. If the Garou becomes drunk on the power, or his need is so great that he cannot afford to let the spirit go before his task is done, he courts disaster. The petitioner must fast for one day and one night before the rite begins, readying his body to be filled with spiritual energy. He scribes glyphs on his body with his own claws, symbols of his dedication drawn in blood, and opened flesh that offers a gateway to the spirit. Then, he must go to the spirit he wishes to petition and make his case. The Rite of Spirit Union doesn't work if the spirit was summoned or commanded with Gifts; it must agree to the union of its own free will. Alternatively, the petitioner can bring along a ritemaster to perform the ritual for him, acting as a mediator. If the Garou (or his ritemaster) persuades the spirit to accede, the pact is made: the spirit agrees to inhabit the body of the petitioner and lend its strength to his cause, and in return the werewolf agrees to take no actions that would go against the spirit's own nature. Once the rite is complete, the two beings merge to become one. The werewolf retains full autonomy, and can only faintly sense the spirit's thoughts and emotions. The merged being takes on the appearance of a fantastical mix between the two. System: To petition a spirit at all for this rite, the Garou must have a Rank that corresponds to the relative importance of the spirit. At Rank 1 or 2, he could only merge with Gafflings, while at Rank 3 or 4 he could merge with Jagglings and at Rank 5 he could petition even the Incarnae. At the time of the rite, the petitioner takes aggravated damage appropriate to the spirit: 1 level for a Gaffling, 3 for a Jaggling, and 5 for an Incarna. The ritemaster's player makes an extended and resisted roll of Charisma + Rituals (difficulty 7) against the spirit's Gnosis (difficulty equal to the werewolf's Gnosis rating). If the player accumulates successes equal to the spirit's Willpower before the spirit accumulates successes equal to the werewolf's Willpower, the rite is successful and the two beings merge. The werewolf's player distributes the spirit's Gnosis rating as dots among his Attributes in any combination, though no Attribute can be increased to more than double its Homid-form rating. The Garou gains access to all the spirit's Charms, spending Gnosis in place of Essence where appropriate. The player can spend the spirit's Gnosis, Rage, and Willpower points as though they were the Garou's own. The Storyteller chooses an appropriate Ban, similar to those imposed by totem spirits, by which the werewolf must abide; if he violates the Ban, the spirit immediately rips free of the union, deeply offended, and the werewolf suffers unsoakable dice of aggravated damage equal to the spirit's Rage. The werewolf can end the union safely at any time by spending one Willpower point and taking a level of lethal damage. The instability of the union means that the werewolf risks burning himself out from the inside if he keeps it going for too long. For every scene after the first that the rite is in effect, the player rolls Rage, with a cumulative +1 difficulty each time. If the Garou frenzies as a result, then after the frenzy ends, he suffers unsoakable dice of aggravated damage equal to his own Rage and expels the spirit forcibly. If this happens, he's likely to lose Renown and the goodwill of the spirit both.",

This rite turns the named offender into a Crinos during the nights of the full moon, but it grants him no control over his anger. During the nights that the target changes, he becomes a rampaging beast. The effects of this ritual last until the second full moon after the rite is completed. On a few rare occasions, the curse has remained with the target for their natural lives. Most humans cannot endure the memory of becoming a Crinos and go quite mad. Others decide to kill themselves, often by ingesting large amounts of belladonna. Sometimes, the accursed seeks aid from dark powers, such as vampires, infernalists, or Black Spiral Dancers, who may unleash him against the sept. When this rite is cast, the target is almost always from among the upper classes. In order to cast this rite, the Garou must gather some of the subject's blood and clothing. These are then presented before a totem spirit, while the target's offenses against Gaia are declared to the spirit. The totem will then seek out the target during the full moon, and work the change upon him. Many Garou do not like this rite, such as the Children of Gaia, who believe that unleashing an uncontrolled Crinos in the land will only lead to suffering. The Red Talons, on the other hand, find it satisfying to witness the carnage the accursed can cause in a town. This rite becomes outlawed in modern times, after too many instances of the target drawing the Wyrm's attention and gaining aid from its minions. In the Dark Ages, however, it is still popular.

Rites requiring Gaia's physical presence (that is, that natural earth, air, water or fire be present) are difficult to perform while the ritemaster is in a setting where they do not exist, such as a ship at sea. The clever No-Moon reasoned that 'there's wind in your lungs, water in your veins, fire in your heart and soil in your bowels.' System: When a ritemaster performs this rite, she may substitute the body of any living creature for the required earth, wind, etc. for a rite that immediately follows. For example, when a rite requires the ritemaster to touch earth, she may hold another's hand instead; a fetish may be held over the heart instead of over a fire. No roll is necessary, although the difficulty of the rite for which the substitution is made is increased by one. It has sadly been shown that even the rite of Gaia's Vengeful Teeth can be cast this way. Soldier-of-Paradise was not successful in his attempts to perform the Rite of Spirit Awakening on his intestinal bacteria, but perseveres nevertheless.",

        "description": "These days, Stargazer caerns are particularly vulnerable places. There is, however, a rather perilous Stargazer rite that some have learned in case their caern is threatened and beyond the ability of the guardians to protect it. With this rite, a Stargazer may take the powerful heart of the caern into her own heart and secret it away from the place so its power may be planted anew, or at least added to the strength of an already existing caern. In performing the rite, a single Stargazer must first successfully perform the Rite of the Opened Caern. Once this is complete, the werewolf must then consume some part of the land surrounding the caern - this may be soil from the ground, water from a lake, or even pieces of brick or concrete if it's an urban caern. Finally, the Stargazer must plead with the totem spirit of the caern, begging and cajoling until finally the caern heart is relinquished for a time, taken deep into the Stargazer's own still-beating organ. But this rite carries with it an exhausting price; the Stargazer who takes this burden unto herself will die soon after performing the rite, as her flesh is simply too frail to handle the potent energies that accompany a caern's own spirit. Her time to affix the caern's heart back to the flesh of the Emerald Mother is severely limited. Knowledge of this rite is exceedingly rare. System: As directed, the Stargazer must first successfully open the caern using the Rite of the Opened Caern. After consuming some part of the caern, the player must roll for the Stargazer to engage in a contest of pleas and supplications versus the caern's totem spirit. The player rolls the ritemaster's Charisma + Performance, with a difficulty of the caern's rating + 4. Even a single success allows the caern heart to be 'carried' by the Stargazer, but every success increases the time the Stargazer may 'carry' the caern with her. One success allows the Stargazer to hold the caern spirit within for a number of hours equal to 10 minus the caern's rating. Every success beyond the first on the roll allows for one full day to be added onto the time allowed. If the Stargazer attempts to keep the caern within past this 'time limit,' she takes one unsoakable aggravated level of damage per hour until she dies. If the Stargazer dies, the caern dies and cannot be recovered. 'Dropping' the caern heart into a new location requires that a number of permanent Gnosis points be spent equal to the caern's rating. If the Stargazer does not have the requisite Gnosis to spend, she may take two aggravated levels per one Gnosis point missing. She must still spend at least one permanent Gnosis point in this manner, however, or the caern is not re-anchored to a new location. At any time during the 'carrying' of the caern's heart, the Stargazer may simply reject the caern spirit and eject it from her form without any roll or Gnosis expenditure - but this unequivocally destroys the caern, and it may never return.",

System: Performed during a raging storm, this rite requires an extended roll of Charisma + Rituals (difficulty 8). The ritemaster must accumulate 10 successes to successfully complete the rite, and may attempt this roll only once per 15 minutes (though for every three Garou beyond the minimum required to complete the rite, the difficulty is reduced by one). If the rite is not completed in one hour, it fails, and the thunderclouds above send down bolts of lightning to punish the offending Garou (inflicting five levels of aggravated damage).

Its very existence is denied outside the tribe, for the Silent Striders believe that the other Garou would turn on all of them if it were discovered that even one camp among them practiced this ritual. In truth, most Striders do not know that it exists, or believe that it is only a myth. The Rite of Dormant Wisdom is only taught to trusted and experienced members of the Eaters of the Dead camp. The ritemaster and his fellow cultists use the Rite of Dormant Wisdom to gain the secrets and memories of the dead by ritually devouring the dead person's brain. The ritual will function properly so long as the brain is intact, regardless of the length of time since the subject's death. Each participant is likely to get a different kind of memory from the subject - for instance, one might get the subject's memories of love, another his memories of voices and sound, and a third the subject's darkest secrets. The Storyteller can vary this thematically based on the participants and the nature of the rite's subject. The Wyrm has its tentacles all over this rite; cannibalism of any sort is expressly forbidden by the Litany. Each use of the ritual brings the character a step closer to the service of Foebok, Urge Wyrm of Fear. System: All those participating in the ritual must roll Intelligence + Occult (difficulty 9). Those who succeed gain some small portion of the dead one's memories and secret knowledge. A participant who gets just one success will get the most recent memories of the deceased, while one who gets five successes will learn the broad range of the subject's life, including many of his most treasured secrets. No participant can gain game abilities (Knowledges, Disciplines, Gifts, Rites, etc.) directly from the use of this ritual, but at the Storyteller's discretion, the rite can be used to justify the expenditure of experience points on game abilities that the rite's subject knew. As described elsewhere, the Wyrm's touch is on this rite. By default, any Garou who takes part in the Rite of Dormant Wisdom a number of times greater than the Garou's permanent Gnosis trait will become a slave of Foebok. However, Storytellers are encouraged to change this mechanic to make the Garou's safety zone less predictable and stimulate roleplay among the troupe. This ritual will work on the corpses of supernatural creatures (such as Garou and immortals) if the participants expend a permanent point of Gnosis. It will also work on vampires, already corpses, if the vampire is unconscious and immobilized. Using this rite on a vampire destroys it. More than five successes are needed to absorb the full life experience of a creature that has lived longer than two centuries.",

A priest who is not reconciled to her own mortality can find the Dark Umbra a disturbing and unsettling place, especially in recent years when a terrible spirit storm has rendered it even more dangerous than usual. Once the purification is complete, the Garou faces a Death's Breath spirit in the early twilight of that evening.

She may remain there until dawn the following morning. System: The player spends a point of Gnosis and rolls Willpower (difficulty 7). If the roll fails, the rite ends and the character is plunged into a terrible Harano-like depression that costs her two dice from every dice pool for the next 24 hours.

This sends all who drink it into a state of Reaching - piercing the Gauntlet and allowing the Near Umbra to become more accessible - that generally lasts for at least three days. The ritemaster and the participants must then focus their attention upon a particular object that is placed at the center of a ritual circle. The ritemaster calls upon Wendigo ancestor-spirits, asking them to tell the story of the object, from its birth until the current time. In this way, the rite can chain together a history of whoever touched the object, what the object was used for, or what it saw, heard, or experienced. If the object is the focus of a very powerful emotion or meaningful event, the ancestor-spirits are more likely to retrieve and share more of their memories. System: Anyone drinking the poisonous nightshade tea automatically spends a point of Gnosis and loses a Health Level. The ritual participants must spend at least 6 Gnosis points to discover any useful information about the object.

She must plead with the dead to hear her apologies or elegies for them (this should be roleplayed). The greater her knowledge of the lost ones, the greater her chance of success. For the following year, the dead will not haunt any that take part in this rite. At the Storyteller's discretion, the dead may communicate with the ritemaster; one or two who have partaken in this rite claim to have gained new knowledge or insights thereby.",

        "description": "The ancient Gaels believed in trial by ordeal to determine guilt or innocence, and some Garou, particularly the Fianna, maintain this tradition. In the event of a Garou violating the Litany, or committing any capital crime, such as rape or murder, and if there is any doubt about the guilt of the violator, this rite is sometimes invoked. The criminal is exiled and cursed for the time of one phase of the moon. The criminal will believe that all rain that falls on him is liquid silver. No permanent damage is done, assuming the criminal survives. But during that month, the violator will suffer terribly. The rain wounds him, and he cannot heal those wounds. He loses his Gnosis and becomes unable to eat. System: The condemned is taken before the ritemaster and the judgment is pronounced. The judge looks into the sky and determines that the condemned is to be exiled from the protectorate for the period of one lunar month, and he cannot return until the moon is in the same phase. The condemned is then splashed with ice-cold water and forcibly escorted from the protectorate. For the period of one lunar month, the condemned cannot regain Gnosis, and every rainfall feels as if he is being lashed by silver. This 'silver' inflicts one level of aggravated damage per shower of rain the character suffers. It cannot be soaked or healed, and in the aftermath, the condemned tends to vomit violently. If the condemned spends a point of Willpower, she can convince herself that the rain is not really silver (and thus suffers no damage). This Willpower can be recovered normally. The wounds do not heal, however, until the time of exile is completed. This punishment is more commonly given in Northern Europe, where it frequently rains, but it always seems to rain just a little bit more when this rite is invoked.",

        "rite_type": "Accord",
        "description": "Some nations purify themselves and prepare to speak in council by partaking of a noxious black liquid that causes them to vomit. It is thought that purging their bodies in this manner cleans them of all impurities and thus gives weight to the truthfulness of their words. Despite its black color, many nations call this the White Drink because of its reputed cleansing properties. The Uktena (and later generations) call it the Black Drink and have built a rite around the consumption of this purgative. When consumed as part of this rite, the Black Drink not only purges as it is meant to do, but ensures that all words spoken for the next hour are true and also reveals whether anyone drinking it harbors a Bane or other unclean spirit within his body. Those so afflicted will seek to escape drinking the liquid and if forced to imbibe it, will be unable to regurgitate it. Their skin mottles visibly with black patches, which last for an hour. System: This rite may only be performed when freshly made Black Drink is available. The drink cannot be carried along and used as a Bane-detector. The point of the rite is to make certain that all parties intend to speak truthfully and clearly; discovering tainted spirits is an added bonus. No roll is needed to enact the rite, but a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 6) allows those in the ritual to notice if someone fails to drink or cannot purge the liquid.",

        "description": "Red Talon lore holds that since the tribe never received a vote on the Litany's tenets, they are not bound by them. While the tribe follows the Litany for the most part, sometimes a Talon is forced to act against the Litany in order to follow her calling as a true predator. The Red Talons recognize that the other tribes may punish the Talon for her 'transgression,' but have devised a means to remove the stigma from her. This rite is only performed if the ritemaster and the leaders feel that another tribe has unjustly subjected a Talon to a Punishment Rite (such as Ostracism, Voice of the Jackal, or Stone of Scorn). The Rite of False Justice cannot disrupt a rite that also confers a death sentence, such as The Hunt or Gaia's Vengeful Teeth (though the tribe may physically protect a Talon whom they feel is being persecuted by such a sentence). The Rite of False Justice is always performed on the half moon. The ritemaster calls the punished Garou before her and asks her to describe in what capacity she was serving Gaia when she broke the Litany. If the Garou's answer satisfies the ritemaster, she howls to the Philodox moon to lift the stigma from the supplicant, as she was serving her true nature, not the false laws, when she transgressed. The Talon is then freed from any Punishment Rite that she currently suffers from and is usually granted a measure of Renown for her honesty and bravery. System: The ritemaster hears the supplicant's case as described above. If the ritemaster judges the Talon worthy of her suffering, no further penalty is incurred. If the ritemaster feels the Talon has been wrongly judged, the player rolls Wits + Rituals (difficulty of the level of the Punishment Rite under which the target currently suffers +5). Success cancels the mystical effects (such as the altered voice granted by Voice of the Jackal) of any previously performed Punishment rite on the supplicant. Any Renown reimbursement or award is up to the Storyteller.",

        "description": "The Garou keep many secrets, something that becomes tricky in the enclosed and overpopulated realm of the city. This rite draws upon the power of local superstition, allowing either the 13th floor of a tall building or room #1 in a hotel to go unnoticed. The performance of the rite involves placing unlucky symbols such as pictures of black cats or the number '13' by the entrance of the place to be hidden. Some ritemasters trying to conceal a hotel room perform a fake ritual murder in the bathroom; those with a captive loyal to the Wyrm may go the extra distance to make the ritual real. System: The resulting successes from the performance of the rite represent the number of successes needed on a Willpower check (difficulty 6) for any observer to actually see the button or entrance to the hidden region. If an actual captive is sacrificed in a genuine murder, the difficulty for the Willpower check rises to 9. This rite affects the perceptions of anyone, supernatural or mortal, who isn't present at the ritual. The effects last for one day per success.",

        "description": "In these days when unity is so important, it is often sorely lacking. Too often, a rift pits pack against pack, tribe against tribe, or sept against sept. A popular Garou may be (possibly wrongly) accused and sentenced, or old resentments flare into open warfare. Despite the Half Moons' best efforts, the fabric of werewolf society is torn asunder. This risky but impressive ritual draws together the most powerful spirits involved in the contention - usually the totems of contending packs, although caern or tribal totems may also be involved. It is a perilous venture, but success will almost certainly bring peace; when the most powerful spirits of a sept speak with one voice, even warring packs will take notice. System: The target number for the Charisma + Rituals roll is equal to the highest spirit type summoned (as per the Rite of Summoning, page 161 of the core book). What follows should make for some intense roleplaying (although the Storyteller may adjust the totems' initial attitude by the number of successes rolled). Once all the spirits are in attendance, the Philodox must lay out the situation and/or plead the case. The spirits give council to, or perhaps interrogate, the Half Moon. If they agree with his decisions, they will stand behind him as he makes (or reiterates) the judgment. If on the other hand they disagree with the arbiter's decision, that too will be made abundantly clear (usually resulting in a loss of Honor Renown and credibility).",

        "rite_type": "Punishment",
        "description": "The Red Talons don't employ a wide variety of Punishment Rites. A serious offense usually merits a sentence of ostracism from the sept (or from the tribe, in extreme cases) or death. However, sometimes an offender must be disciplined severely but left alive and intact. On these occasions, the Talons employed the feared Rite of the Human Mind. All Red Talons - indeed, all Garou - have both a human-mind and a wolf-heart, according to the Talons. The human mind is dominant in Homid form, while the wolf-heart dominates in Lupus form. A Red Talon who relies too heavily on his human-mind, or shows mercy or compassion to a human that then comes back to bite him (as is often the case), might be subject to this rite. Any incompetence or faulty logic that the elders believe to stem from the human-mind, or relying on human babble when instinct is clearly called for, might also result in the Rite of the Human Mind being employed. To perform this rite, the ritemaster must assume Homid form, as must the accused. The ritemaster calls the accused by his name in whatever human tongue is convenient, and then changes to Lupus form and howls in derision. Any observers also take up the howl, but at no time during these howls is the accused referred to by his howl-name. When the howls die down, the accused finds himself unable to access his wolf-heart, even in Lupus form. This punishment may last for any amount of time, but the Talons usually consider it too cruel to maintain it for longer than one moon. System: Roll Charisma + Rituals (difficulty 7). If the rite succeeds, the accused does not gain Perception bonuses while in Lupus, Hispo, or Crinos forms and is considered to have no dots in Primal-Urge for as long as the rite lasts. On lupus Garou, the attendant discomfort this brings also levels +3 to all Willpower difficulties and a -2 to initiative results for the duration of the punishment. The character thinks like a human being, even in Lupus form, and a player whose character is subjected to this rite should do her best to roleplay this experience. The Storyteller is free to impose additional penalties if she feels that the player is having too easy a time of it.",

        "rite_type": "Caern",
        "description": "This rite creates a moon bridge, a shimmering portal serving as a mystical means of transportation between two caerns. Such moon bridges are vital links between the sacred spaces of Gaia. Once per year, a caern must renew its connection with other caerns to which it wishes to maintain moon bridges. This rite is always held during a moot, and it must be enacted simultaneously by both participating caerns. The primary requirement to open a moon bridge is a moongem, or pathstone as it is most often called. Pathstones are found in the Umbra, and they are often the objects of quests. These extraordinarily rare stones resemble flat pearls with the imprint of a wolfs paw on one side. It is possible to steal a pathstone from a caern, but such a theft is considered blasphemous, and it may well result in war between two Garou septs. The rite establishes (or reestablishes) a spiritual connection between the pathstones of two second caerns by way of the caerns' totem spirits. At the rite's culmination, a moon bridge opens between the two participating caerns. During this time, Garou from both septs can travel between the caerns to join in a wild revel. Moon bridges allow Garou to traverse distances in l/1000th the normal time required. This rite must be renewed once every 13 moons (roughly a year). System: The roll is Wits + Enigmas (difficulty 8 minus the level of the ritemaster's own caern). The ritemaster may spend Willpower on the roll. If her pack totem is the same as the totem of the caern, she receives a bonus of three dice to the roll. If the rite was unsuccessful previously, the difficulty level of the rite increases by one. The ritemaster needs to obtain a number of successes equal to the target caern's level to complete the rite. If the rite succeeds, the moon bridge opens immediately, and the spirit-bond between the two pathstones is established. Moon bridges may now be opened at any time between the two caerns. The bridges may be opened with the Rite of the Opened Caern or the Ragabash Gift: Open Moon Bridge (if performed at the caern). If the rite fails, no moon bridge opens, and the rite must be tried again next year. Moon bridges to the caern may still be opened, but they are not as safe as they might be.... If the rite botches, no moon bridge opens, and the pathstone in the caern is scorched by the badly handled energies. Botching this rite often leads to another rite - the Rite of Ostracism - being performed against the offending Garou. See Caerns Mechanics (p. 226) for moon bridge distances.",

This rain cleanses all Wyrm impurities, and can even heal wounds. System: This rite works in much the same way as the Rite of Cleansing (Werewolf, p. 157), but can encompass an entire caern and those within it. The ritemaster expends only one point of Gnosis to cleanse an area, but for every two additional points he spends every character within the caern heals one level of damage. The difficulty of this rite depends on the level of taint, such as a tainted spirit's Gnosis rating. Like the Rite of Cleansing, the difficulty of this rite can also be lowered by one if performed at dawn. Beings of the Wyrm and vampires suffer excruciating pain if exposed to this rite, though they are not cleansed or genuinely damaged. To use this rite outside a caern, the ritemaster must sacrifice three permanent points of Gnosis.",

        "description": "Tribe: Shadow Lords Time: October 5 Two weeks following the Autumnal equinox, the Shadow Lords of Japan and the Far East observe the Rite of the Opened Claw. Western Shadow Lords may also observe this rite, but it is far more common among their Eastern brethren. The rite is a unique interpretation of a Japanese Tea Ceremony. The ritemaster places bowls of a bitter brew, known as Ke-Chuin, upon the ground. The ingredients of the brew are known only to those Shadow Lords taught the Rite of the Opened Claw. The ceremony itself is exacting, and the watching Garou of the sept are ever alert for a mistake or hesitation by the ritemaster. Although the sept's leader may designate as ritemaster any Shadow Lord in his domain who knows the rite, the leader almost always takes on this role himself, for the dangers of allowing another to make the brew are obvious to any Shadow Lord leader worth the name. After the pouring of the Ke-Chuin, the ritemaster searches the faces of the assembled Garou to determine whom Mother Gaia and Father Thunder have chosen to partake of the tea. Ke-Chuin is said to open the claw that surrounds the spirit, revealing it in its true glory or depravity. Those Shadow Lords who know this rite claim to see a burning halo or aura around those chosen. Those Garou chosen must step forward and drink deeply of the bitter brew. The ritemaster closely watches the imbiber's aura, claiming that any sign of Wyrm taint or corruption will immediately be revealed. This may indeed occur, as the Garou named corrupt inevitably die within minutes of drinking the Ke-Chuin. Members of other tribes have, perhaps uncharitably, remarked how often the ritemaster's enemies or those who have displeased him are among the Garou who die of their exposed taint. Those whose auras reflect purity after drinking of the Ke-Chuin often gain position in their sept. System: If the rite is unsuccessful, the ritemaster will be unable to truly detect any sort of aura from the assembled Garou. A botch indicates that the ritemaster will have a fatal reaction to the Ke-Chuin tea.",
