If the subject is a vampire, the modification heals as normal when the 'charges' are expended. If the subject is a mortal, the tattoo or piercing remains, but loses its vampire puissance. A vampire subject can choose to spend a point of permanent Willpower to make the modification relatively permanent.",

Within one scene after the trance ends, the player makes an Intelligence + Survival roll. If the roll is successful, the vampire may temporarily increase her Self-Control, Conscience, or Courage by a single dot. This increase lasts for the remainder of the scene. The difficulty of the roll is equal to double the Trait's current rating. Only one Virtue can be increased at a time. Furthermore, the source of the trance has to be appropriate for the Virtue. When a Kindred uses Bliss to steel the resolve of another, the roll to activate the power is Wits + Expression. Additionally, difficulties for using Bliss on someone other than oneself increase by one. Botching any Bliss roll results in the loss of a Willpower point (minimum 1).
