Note that since a character that has no dots in a Knowledge cannot normally use that Knowledge at all, a character with this Gift must use it to make such an attempt at all. For example, Eyes-like-Hornets, a Red Talon Ragabash, gets into a conversation with a human woman and attempts to tell her a joke. The werewolf doesn't have any dots in Expression, however, and fails the Charisma + Expression roll to get the woman to laugh. The player spends a Gnosis point and makes another roll, adding a die. This time, it succeeds. Eyes-like-Hornets recognizes that his first attempt at humor didn't go over as he'd hoped, and covers it up. If Eyes-like-Hornets didn't have any dots in Linguistics and way trying to simply communicate with the woman, his player would have to spend a point of Gnosis for each attempt to do, as he cannot attempt to use a Knowledge he doesn't have.

One success allows the character to move at twice her normal speed; two successes gives her three times normal speed, while three successes allows the character to move four times as quickly. More than three successes cause the character to assume a blurry form that confers two extra dice to any rolls involving Dexterity while the character is in motion. The effect lasts for one turn or one scene, depending on the circumstance. This Gift affects movement only and cannot allow a character to stop to deliver blows in combat without ending the Gift's duration. Thus, a character can use the Gift to get to a combat more quickly, but once she engages in battle, she loses the benefits conferred by the Gift.",
