She will attack anything that gets too close, within the usual guidelines of frenzy (i.e., if her Rage is equal to or lower than her Gnosis, she will not attack packmates). While in this state, the Talon takes no wound penalties. All difficulties to soak are reduced by two, and she gains an extra dot of Strength. Additionally, she regains one Rage point each turn while the Gift is in effect, making it impossible for her to run out of Rage (and therefore impossible to lose to the wolf).

To realize something isn't right, observers must make a Perception + Investigation roll (difficulty 7) and achieve at least the same number of successes the “dead” werewolf achieved. A view from the Penumbra shows the spirit still resides in the body, but appears to be in some kind of Slumber. During this death trance, the Uktena need not breathe, but fire and such can still hurt him badly. Physical wounds do not bleed until the trance is lifted, but neither do they heal. The character may hear, smell, and see (assuming his eyes are open) while in the death trance, but all rolls to perceive anything are at +2 difficulty. The Death Trance Gift lasts as long as the Uktena wishes. However, to wake at any time during the first day requires a successful Willpower roll difficulty 4 (to fully revive requires three turns, plus one turn per day spent in a death state). Every day after that the difficulty increases by 1. If the Garou fails to wake in time, he must wait a day before trying again (although the Storyteller may make allowances, such as friends trying to wake him, or he finds himself on a pyre). After a number of days equal to the character's permanent Gnosis rating, his spirit slips loose from the husk and the character dies.

One success summons one of two creatures; additional successes increase the number of creatures or spirits that answer the summons. Thus, two successes bring up to five respondents, three successes summon up to ten creatures, four successes results in up to 15 beings while five successes brings everything within a five-mile radius of the character. Those creatures summoned serve as an army under the character's command for an entire scene. Of course, if there are no wild predators or War-spirits of Nerigal within range, the Gift fails.",
