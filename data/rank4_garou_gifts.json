It doesn't make them stronger, or give them the instincts that Garou have, but they make fine decoys when being hunted by the Wyrm. Like Airitech's Daughters, these werewolves exist to be murdered. The Gift is taught by an ancestor spirit.",

They do not receive any of the benefits of the Crinos form, do not cause Delirium, and are not protected by the Veil; the change is largely cosmetic. They may, however, receive a bonus to Intimidation rolls. This Gift does not work on anyone but mortal humans. It will not affect mages, changelings, vampires or even the Imbued; it will, however, work on Kinfolk, ghouls and sorcerers.",

Anyone reaching for something high in a cupboard will inevitably have the entire contents fall on top of him. Riding a bicycle on a sunny day invites being hit by a truck.

A botch on this roll sends the Garou into immediate frenzy, as her body rejects the process. After the first eight hours have passed, the lupus sinks into a state of deep sleep. She needs no food or water, all bodily functions cease, and she doesn't age. This hibernation lasts one week per success on the roll, though each pair of Gnosis and Willpower points spend in excess of the first increases the internal from weeks into months, years or even decades. No more than three Gnosis and Willpower can be spent to increase the interval, although Galliard tales abound of ancient Garou sleeping under mountains or in the frozen north, waiting for the call to rouse and take up arms against the Wyrm again. The werewolf can be woken prematurely if she takes enough damage to become Wounded or worse, if her player succeeds at a Willpower roll (difficulty 8) or if the rite Call to Arms is performed (Changing Ways p. 157). She can attempt a Willpower roll to wake once per day. As soon as she wakes, whether prematurely or after the full hibernation period has passed, she must roll Rage at -1 difficulty to see if she frenzies, or -2 difficulty if her injuries woke her.",
