It doesn't make them stronger, or give them the instincts that Garou have, but they make fine decoys when being hunted by the Wyrm. Like Airitech's Daughters, these werewolves exist to be murdered. The Gift is taught by an ancestor spirit.",

They may, however, receive a bonus to Intimidation rolls. This Gift does not work on anyone but mortal humans. It will not affect mages, changelings, vampires or even the Imbued; it will, however, work on Kinfolk, ghouls and sorcerers.",

Anyone reaching for something high in a cupboard will inevitably have the entire contents fall on top of him. Riding a bicycle on a sunny day invites being hit by a truck.
