Should the Fury succeed, the next Gaian ritual she participates in will seem innocuous and appropriate to the crowd on hand. If Truest Sacrament is used during or after a ritual - if one or more humans happen upon a group of Garou during a rite - the same dice pool as above is used, but the character must also spend one point of Gnosis. Note that Truest Sacrament will not cover up truley egregious or spectacular violations of the Veil - spattering blood, spirit fireworks, and so on, will be remembered and probably not thought of as harmless or normal. But if the rite is simpler, or the more hallucinatory effects can somehow be concealed from witnesses, the Furies may get away with it.

Regardless of the true nature of their abilities, many Freebooters can sniff out the locations of dormant caerns (that is, those once opened whose power has since faded).

The base difficulty for the roll is 7, if the source of power is within ten miles; decrease it by 1 if the distance is less than 1 mile, and increase it by 1 if the distance is between ten and twenty miles - Omen of power cannot detect sources of power greater than twenty miles distant. This difficulty is decreased by 2 if the source of power is an active caern, and increased by 1 if it is a fetish rather than a dormant caern. By default, this Gift is acurate to within about 20% - if a caern is within 10 miles, Omen of Power will give it's distance and direction to within about 2 miles. Additional successes on the Gift's activation roll decrease that margin of error by 5%. The Gift can be re-used as the Garou close in on the source of power, to further refine their target's location.

Even out of frenzy, the Bacchantes recognize the intimidation factor of rending a foe with fang and claw, and many revel in its primal nature.

In case that a given object does not have a soak or armor rating, treat the Fury's Strength as being three higher for purposes of the Feat of Strength needed to rip through the object.

A good old-fashioned hootenanny involves music plaed really fast and incredibly well - “Dueling Banjos” is currently the most common song used with it. While a Garou enacts this performance, every werewolf in his pack finds it easier to run, fight, jump, or perform any other rapid, strenuous physical activity. Unfortunately, everyone who hears the performance feels like dancing-they might stomp their feet, clap to the music, and even dance around if the music's good enough. This gives the pack a decided edge in combat. With this Gift, a pack of Hillfolk and a Galliard with a banjo can tear up a whole room full of fomori and Black Spirals with one hell of a square dance. This Gift is taught by an ancestor-spirit, usually one that looks and acts like a Galliard. Some Galliards claim this Gift is taught by the ghost of Elvis, but no one believes them.",

If the character scores three successes on the first turn, the Gift is activated; if he doesn't he can continue to attempt the roll each turn until he does. For the duration of one scene, as long as he continues to perform, each Garou in his pack can add three extra dice to any Dexterity + Brawl or Athletics dice pool. A packmate can add these dice to only one action each round, or he may divide them among multiple actions, but he cannot use more than three bonus dice from this Gift in a turn. Any enemies listening should make willpower rolls when this power is activated. If an opponent hearing the music can't score at least three successes on this roll, raise the difficulty of all his Dexterity + Brawl or Athletics dice pools by 2.

Before the Uktena goes to sleep, the player spends one point of Gnosis and rolls Charisma + Occult, difficulty 8. If the roll is successful, then the Uktena will awaken with new insights in how to heal the sick person. Each success on the Occult roll adds one dice to any Medicine rolls for that day. Should this grant the Uktena more than ten dice on his Medicine dice pool, he may even attempt to cure incurable illnesses such as terminal cancer or HIV/AIDS. To do so, six or more successes are needed on appropriate Medicine rolls.",

Rather than merely creating a glitch, this Gift actually disrupts the Weaver energy by overpowering it with the chaos of the Wyld. Devices may function in reverse of normal (clocks run backward, cars only drive in reverse, computers print out information upside down) or may function in some totally random manner (guns explode when used; missiles reprogram themselves to hit a random target after initiating their own countdown and firing sequence; cars only function underwater).

Further, it seems to urge the Garou toward a direction she needs to travel. Thus, if something terrible is happening in the Umbra, use of this Gift will point the Garou right toward it.

He may be pursuing a fleeing Wyrm-spirit or Black Spiral Dancer, or he might be running for his life from similar foes. Rooftop Sprint makes such a chase much more survivable - and even winnable - for the Garou who uses it. He becomes able to leap up and down several stories, and easily spring across open alleyways. The primary restriction on the character's movement is that he cannot touch the ground, or the Gift's effect ends at once.",
        "system": "The player must spend a point of Rage and roll Dexterity + Athletics (difficulty 6). For every success achieved, the character can jump up or down one story (3 meters) or 3 meters horizontally, without danger or difficulty. Athletics rolls can improve jumping distances, just as always; the effects of those Athletics rolls just add to the result given by this Gift. The Gift's effects last for one scene, or until the character touches the ground at street level - if the Garou touches pavement, grass, or anything else commonly considered 'ground' he is considered to have touched ground, but if he leaps from car roof to car roof he should be okay. Rooftop Sprint is taught by an alleycat-spirit.",

Such plants might be healing herbs, substances used in rites or tubers and other plants that provide needed sustenance. The song causes the plants to resonate from the music so that the Garou can locate them by following the sounds.",

Additional successes increase the range by one mile per success. Failure means that the character cannot hear any plants, while a botch leads the character to harmful herbs or plants.",

In this state, unlike a normal frenzy, the Get can pull out of the frenzy at any time. An angry wolverine-spirit or bear-spirit teaches this Gift to the Get.",

The number of successes on a Stamina + Expression (or Performance) roll (difficulty 6) equals the number of rounds the frenzy lasts. She can drop the frenzy earlier by spending a Willpower point.",
