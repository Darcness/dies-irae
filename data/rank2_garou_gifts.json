But if the rite is simpler, or the more hallucinatory effects can somehow be concealed from witnesses, the Furies may get away with it.

The base difficulty for the roll is 7, if the source of power is within ten miles; decrease it by 1 if the distance is less than 1 mile, and increase it by 1 if the distance is between ten and twenty miles – Omen of power cannot detect sources of power greater than twenty miles distant. This difficulty is decreased by 2 if the source of power is an active caern, and increased by 1 if it is a fetish rather than a dormant caern. By default, this Gift is acurate to within about 20% – if a caern is within 10 miles, Omen of Power will give it's distance and direction to within about 2 miles. Additional successes on the Gift's activation roll decrease that margin of error by 5%. The Gift can be re-used as the Garou close in on the source of power, to further refine their target's location.
