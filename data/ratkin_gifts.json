The Munchmausen must compose a song or poem while using Rapier Wit, adding a stanza at least every time he attempts to parry or riposte. If the Ratkin is unarmed, the player must also describe what items nearby he is using in combat instead. A chair, a chandelier or mug of ale can be deadly if wielded by a witty Munchmausen.",
		"system": "When the Ratkin begins using Rapier Wit, the player improvises the first two lines of an original poem or song. Mark off one Gnosis. Any time the Munchmausen is assaulted with a Brawl or Melee attack, she may attempt to automatically parry and counterattack. This lasts for the rest of the scene, and works in addition to the Munchausen's other actions. Each time the Ratkin is attacked, the player must add another two lines to the poem or song. The composition need not necessarily make sense, but it must at least rhyme. For a successful parry and counterattack, the Munchmausen rolls Dexterity + Expression. The difficulty of the first roll starts out at 6. Each time the Munchausen parries and adds another two lines to her composition, the Storyteller determines whether the difficulty of the next parry should go up by 1 or down by 1, depending on the ingenuity of the poem or song. (Optionally, players can vite using the 'thumbs up/thumbs down' methods like the one used in the Warrior Gift: Improvisation.) The difficulty of the parry/counterattack can never go lower than 4 or higher than 10. To parry, she must score more successes than the attacker did on his attack roll. The damage for the counterattack is equal to Strength, although the Storyteller may add a die or two if the weapon is particularly vicious. If the weapon does aggravated damage, so does the counterattack. Her opponent can attempt to soak damage, but cannot dodge or Parry the counterattack. The Gift lasts for the rest of the scene; hopefully by then, the Munchmausen's masterpiece will be complete.",

As usual, a Twitcher cannot create more than one Pain Dagger at a time; however, they don't worry about losing Obligation Renown for performing irreverent or obscene acts with them. Unfortunately, the spirit inside a Sanctified Pain Dagger may whisper to the Twitcher who carries it; only the owner can hear these disturbing messages.

Over his dying body, you must recite the greatest accomplishments of his life. All of his Gifts will be gone, but his memories and spirit will remain. Of course, he can be bound or manipulated like any other ephemera, but some wererats are willing to make this ultimate sacrifice in service to the Rat Goddess.",

He gets his shot at Final Rage first - rolling Stamina at difficulty 8 and healing one health level per success - so you can only proceed if he fails that roll. Decide how much Gnosis you want to invest into the Elegy. The dying Ratkin you're trying to help then rolls Gnosis; the difficulty is equal to 10 minus his Rank. Each point of Gnosis you spend before the roll adds one success; if the dying rat gets at least five successes, his flesh withers away. He's reborn as a Rat Jaggling and scampers off into the Umbra.",
