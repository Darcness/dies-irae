]









• Call for Aid: With an expenditure of five Essence, the
spirit calls upon other entities of its kind. The Storyteller
rolls the spirit’s Willpower, with the difficulty based on
the likelihood of other spirits being nearby at the time:
difficulty 3 if the other spirits are within sight, difficulty
6 in an area where such spirits are common, difficulty
8 for unusual spirits within that region, and difficulty
9 for rare spirits outside their normal habitat.
• Cleanse the Blight: With a wave of purifying energy,
a nature spirit, angel, or other benevolent entity can
purge spiritual corruption from its immediate area. The
Storyteller rolls the spirit’s Gnosis against a difficulty
based on the level of corruption – from 4 or 5 for an
area with mild taint to 9 or 10 for areas of massive abuse
and sickness. This Charm costs 10 Essence.
• Cling: Using this Charm, an entity can cling to an
object or another creature. The spirit must first make
a successful grappling attack in order to hang onto an
unwilling target. After a successful grappling roll, the
spirit gains five extra Willpower dice for the purposes
of hanging on and resisting other grappling attacks.
Once the spirit latches on, the target can free himself
only by reducing the Spirit’s Essence to zero, pulling it
free with a successful grappling attack, or else binding
the spirit into a fetish. This Charm costs one Essence
point per use, but it lasts until the spirit lets go or is
otherwise removed.
• Control Electrical Systems: Engaging its bond with
technology, an electricity elemental or spirit of electrical
tech can seize control of an electric device and run it
according to the spirit’s desires. The Storyteller rolls
the spirit’s Gnosis against a difficulty based upon the
complexity of the machine or system – from 3 to control
light bulbs to 9 to control a HIT Mark or cybernetic gear.
The Essence cost likewise depends upon the sophistication
of the device, from one Essence to control simple objects
to five Essence to command complex machinery.
• Corruption:As a demon or other spiritual temper employs
this Charm, the Storyteller spends one Essence point. The
spirit whispers foul suggestions in the target’s ear (perhaps
in a voice only that victim can hear…), and the victim
must make a Willpower roll or else act out the corrupting
spirit’s suggestions. If that character might be inclined to
act on the suggestion to begin with (like, say, a bank teller
facing a bunch of money that hasn’t yet been logged into
the system), she might not even try to resist it.
• Create Fire: With a successful Gnosis roll, the spirit
can ignite a fire. The difficulty depends upon the size
of blaze – from 3 for small fires to 9 for an inferno.
The Essence cost also depends upon the size of the fire,
ranging from one point for a simple flicker to five for
a conflagration.
• Create Wind: Elemental air command conjures
windstorms. Essence cost ranges from one for a light
breeze to 20 for a tornado.
• Death Fertility: Is something already killing a living
thing? If so, a spirit can use this Charm to accelerate
the process. Assuming that the target’s already suffering
from some malady – injury, infection, starvation,
freezing, disease, poison, etc. – an expenditure of five
Essence and a Rage roll against the target’s Willpower
Trait will inflict further damage upon the target. Each
success causes one health level of lethal harm, and the
spreading sickness or wound might have other effects
as well – see Health and Injury, Harsh Weather and
Environments, Starvation and Thirst, and Drugs,
Poison, and Disease for possible effects.
• Digital Disruption:Deployed only by Digital Web entities,
this Charm inflicts either a soft de-rez – that is, one that
dumps the target out of the Web and back into Meatspace
without hurting him – or a hard de-rez, which inflicts two
automatic health levels in lethal damage and deducts two
points of a Mental Attribute unless the target makes a
Stamina roll, difficulty 7 (the damage and Trait loss heal
as lethal damage). The entity must hit the target with a
Willpower-based attack roll, but success automatically
dumps the target out of Netspace. A soft de-rez costs
three Essence, and a hard one costs five.
• Disable: This stunning Charm can paralyze a single
victim. The Storyteller rolls the spirit’s Rage against the
appropriate difficulty (target’s Stamina + 3, or Rage if
the target is another spirit). Cost is one Essence point
for each level of the target’s current health or one point
per Essence point if the Charm gets used against a spirit492 Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition
entity. Minimum cost is 10 Essence. The paralysis lasts
one turn for every Essence point spent… and yes, the
spirit can spend extra Essence to disable its opponent
for longer periods of time.
• Disorient: By altering both nearby landmarks and
the target’s sense of direction, the entity confuses its
opponents on either side of the Gauntlet. To do so, the
Storyteller rolls the spirit’s Gnosis against difficulty 6 or
the local Gauntlet rating, whichever is higher. Possessed
only by spirits of confusion and the raw Dynamic energies
often called Wyld spirits, this Charm costs no Essence.
• Dream Journey: For 10 Essence points (15 if the spirit
wants the target to remember it in the morning), an entity
may intrude on a sleeping subject’s dreams. Although the
Charm has no lasting effects beyond the emotional pain or
comfort involved in that dream, the spirit can do whatever
it damn well pleases within the confines of the dream realm.
Of course, if the subject is a lucid dreamer with a Demesne,
the intruder might get more than it bargained for… See
the Lucid Dreaming Talent (p. 294) and the Demesne
Background (pp. 310-311) in Chapter Six for details.
• Ease Pain: By spending one Essence, the spirit may ease
another creature’s pain. In game terms, this alleviates all
wound-based penalties except penalties to movement.
The Charm doesn’t actually heal the injuries, however –
it merely soothes the pain involved. Each Essence point
removes the subject’s pain for roughly one hour.
• Element Sense: Through instinctive contact with its
native element (earth, fire, etc.), an elemental spirit can
sense things that happen to be touching, or happening
near, sources of that entity’s element. When activated,
this Charm extends in a circle roughly 500 feet around
the elemental itself and lets the entity perceive things that
occur within a yard or two of its element, so long as the
source of that element lies within the area affected by the
Charm. A fire elemental, for instance, could sense things
within a yard of a candle flame or fireplace if that flame
flickers within 500 feet of the elemental itself. Each use of
this Charm costs five Essence and lasts roughly an hour.
• Feedback:Possessed only by certain aggressive Digital Web
spirits, this Charm fires off a shattering wail of sonic or
electronic feedback. Every two points of Essence put into
the attack inflics one health level of bashing damage in
the form of headaches, scrambled senses, mental trauma,
and misfiring nervous systems. Every five points in the
attack inflict a level of lethal damage – cooking organs,
killing brain cells, electrocuting flesh, and disrupting
muscular control. This Charm affects only travelers in
the Digital Web, but it can kill their meat back home.
• Flee: With this Charm, the spirit can temporarily boost
its Willpower to 15 for the purposes of escaping danger.
This bonus does not actually raise the Trait with regards
to activities other than escape, although it might aid a
spirit who’s trying to avoid or hide from a confrontation.
Costs two Essence per turn.
• Flood: A typical trick for storm spirits and water
elements, this Charm raises the natural water level to
flood a given area. The size of that area depends upon
the power of the spirit: a Gaffling-level entity could
flood a small building or a short city block, whereas a
Jaggling could flood a small town. (Don’t ask how much
an Incarna could flood with this Charm…) The Charm
normally costs one point of Essence per turn to use,
and it generally takes several turns to flood a significant
area. If there is no water around, the spirit would have
to import some via storm clouds, broken water mains,
or other potential sources of a flood.
• Freeze:A sudden drop in temperature frosts the immediate
area. The spirit’s Rage Trait drops by one, and every
character within that area suffers one health level in
lethal damage for every point in the spirit’s new Rage
Trait. (Rage 6 would drop to Rage 5, inflicting five dice
of lethal damage, for example.) The range of this Charm
is roughly 20 feet (three meters) for every dot in the spirit’s
permanent Rage Trait. That sharp drop in temperature
could have other effects too – see Harsh Weather and
Environments under Environmental Hazards.
• Healing: With a surge of spiritual energy, the spirit can
heal an injured physical being. To do so, the Storyteller
rolls the spirit’s Gnosis – difficulty 6 for lethal damage,
difficulty 8 for aggravated damage. That spirit can heal
one health level for each point in that spirit’s Gnosis
Trait and may use this Charm only once on a character
per scene. The spirit could heal each of six characters,
for example, but it could only do so once. The Charm
costs no Essence, but the spirit will probably want some
sort of favor in return for the healing.
• Illuminate: Suffusing itself with light, the entity
illuminates an area roughly 20 yards or meters from its
body or changes the color and intensity of existing lights
in the area. This Charm requires no roll or Essence cost.
• Influence: For three Essence points, the spirit can
gradually shift a subject’s mood in whichever direction
that spirit desires. A successful roll of that entity’s Gnosis
against the subject’s Willpower sets the Charm in motion;
the spirit can then influence that person from a distance,
with no words or obvious contact between them.
• Inhabit: A lesser and more benign version of the
Possession Charm allows the spirit to briefly inhabit a
living creature or inanimate object. That spirit slips into
the subject, speaking with her voice and perceiving through
her various senses. The Storyteller makes a Gnosis roll,
difficulty of the subject’s Willpower (for a living target) or
the local Gauntlet (for an object). If the subject consentsChapter Nine: Dramatic Systems 493
to be inhabited, no roll is necessary. This Charm costs
five Essence and lasts for one scene. If the spirit tries to
compel its host into any sort of harm or danger, the spirit
is immediately ejected from that host.
• Insight: Through this Charm, an entity can puzzle out
one hidden element of a target’s identity, history, or
personality. If the spirit tries to uncover a specific piece
of information, the Charm costs 10 Essence; if the entity
simply attempts to find something worth using, the cost
is only five Essence.
• Iron Will:By deciding upon a single, specific course of action
(guard this place, watch this child, find this book, and so forth), a
spirit may invoke this Charm and add five extra dice to any
roll that helps it meet that purpose or resist being driven
away from the task. Costs one Essence per hour.
• Lightning Bolt: With a surge of power, the entity
hurls a thunderbolt. Costs two Essence for each die of
lethal damage inflicted. (See also the Blast Charm and
Electrocution under Environmental Hazards.)
• Materialize: This Charm allows a spirit to assume
physical shape in the material world… a dangerous thing,
especially in the age of machine-gun fire. To do so, the
spirit’s Gnosis must be higher than the local Gauntlet
rating. Once materialized, the spirit can go wherever
it wants to go, provided that the local Gauntlet rating
is no higher than the spirit’s Gnosis -2, and assuming
that no one has bound that spirit in a mystic pentacle
or hypertech spirit cage (in game terms, a Spirit 4 Effect;
see the Spirit Sphere entry in Chapter Ten.) If the entity
gets killed in the material realm, its form is dispersed and
the spirit winds up banished to the Umbra in Slumber,
as if its Essence had been dispersed in the spirit realm.
Under the old World of Darkness rules, a materialized
spirit had to buy its Physical Attributes, health levels,
and Abilities per the chart below. (A materialized spirit
still uses its Gnosis for Social and Mental Attributes.)
This approach allows a spirit to expand its capabilities,
so long as it has enough Essence to do so. Alternately,
the spirit can simply manifest and use its Willpower,
Rage, Gnosis, and Essence as usual, without bothering
to generate Attributes and Abilities, as per Werewolf:
The Apocalypse 20th Anniversary Edition. In that case,
however, the spirit remains bound to a single form in the
Earthly realm and cannot adjust its size or capabilities. The
spirits in Appendix I have been built using the physical
forms suggested by the older rules.
Typically, a spirit soaks damage with its Willpower Trait, plus
the Armor Charm if it has that power. When a materialized
spirit gets hit, however, the Stamina Trait (plus armor)
soaks damage if that Trait is higher than Willpower. To a
materialized spirit entity, bashing, lethal, and aggravated
damage are essentially the same – all three drain Essence
points if they manage to inflict damage against the spirit’s
body. If that spirit takes damage, its materialized health levels
absorb the damage first; once those health levels are gone,
the spirit can take up to five more health levels in damage
before its Essence dissipates back into the Umbra. Whether
or not the dead materialized husk remains behind after
the spirit’s Essence has departed is a Storyteller call. Given
the long histories of “demon’s blood,” “angel feathers,”
and “dead alien bodies,” however, tradition suggests that
a corpse should remain behind.
Essence
Cost

5 Initial manifestation (Paradox spirits
do not pay this cost).

1 Seven initial health levels.
1 Per additional health levels (each extra
health level also increases size).
1 Weaponry; per die of aggravated
damage above Strength damage.
1 Per physical health level healed.
• Meld: Elemental spirits can merge with their native
element by using this Charm, simply disappearing into
the element in question. This trick works only for the
spirit’s native element, however – an air elemental cannot
meld into wood. The charm costs two Essence and one
turn to employ. At the end of that time, the element
may be disturbed by the spirit’s passage, but the spirit
itself cannot be seen or affected. Obviously, this Charm
requires a decent amount of the element in question.
• Mind Speech: For three Essence, a spirit can project
images and impressions, or speak directly into a subject’s
mind, using a form of telepathy. The subject understands
the spirit in whatever language she considers her native
tongue. If the subject resists the message, the spirit could
spend three Essence per die to try to win a resisted roll
against the target’s Willpower (difficulty 6 for both parties).
• Open Moon Bridge: A willing spirit with this Charm
may open up a moon bridge from one Umbral location
to another. For such service, of course, that entity will
want a significant favor. The Charm costs no Essence,
and the moon bridge can reach up to 1000 miles (1600
km) from the spirit’s current location.
• Peek: The entity peers through the Gauntlet from the
Penumbra to the physical world. Costs no Essence.
• Possession: The awful power of demons and other
corrupting entities, this Charm allows a spirit to enter and
command an object or living thing. As with the Inhabit
Charm, Possession allows the spirit to see, hear, speak, and494 Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition
otherwise interact with the world through the target’s body;
in this case, however, that body may be warped in horrific
ways through the spirit’s influence… becoming, in many
cases, a freakish fomor (see Werewolf: The Apocalypse and
Infernalism: The Path of Screams for details).
It’s an article of faith that a possessed person has to bear
some previous form of corruption in order to open the
door for demonic possession. Whether or not this is
true remains a Storyteller call. In any case, the possessing
entity finds a secluded spot in the Umbra (often protected
by other allied entities) and then begins the possession
process. In game terms, the Storyteller spends 10 Essence
and then rolls the spirit’s Gnosis against a difficulty of
the target’s Willpower (or, for an object, difficulty 4). The
better she rolls, the faster the possession takes place:
Successes Time Taken
1 Six hours.
2 Three hours.
3 One hour.
4 15 minutes.
5 Five minutes.
6+ Instantaneous.
Until the possession is complete, the entity may be
attacked in the Umbra; any successful attack on that
entity breaks the Charm. Once the possession has taken
hold, however, the corruption is usually permanent. A
successful exorcism using Spirit 4/Life 3/ Prime 2 magick
can eject the spirit from its host, as can a successful
attack through the True Faith Merit (see Appendix II).
Until and unless such exorcisms have been performed,
however, this Charm and its effects tend to last until
the spirit departs its host.
• Quake:This elemental power allows the spirit to literally
shake the material world. For five Essence, the entity
can cause the earth to shake, rattle, and roll within a
one mile radius of that spirit’s presence on either side
of the Gauntlet. Each additional five Essence escalates
the intensity of the quake, from a notable tremor at five
to a devastating catastrophe at 30.
• Re-form:For 20 Essence, the spirit may instantly disappear
from its current location and appear somewhere else in
the spirit realms… usually far away from its enemies.
• Shapeshift: With a five-point expenditure of Essence,
the spirit can look like whatever it wants to look like.
That new form doesn’t have any additional powers or
abilities, though spirits tend to be fairly protean when
it comes to things like image, limbs, or size.
• Short Out: Three Essence allow the entity to short out
nearby electrical systems with a Gnosis roll, difficulty 6.
Some systems, however, are harder to disrupt than other
ones are, especially when hypertech is involved – see the
Control Electrical Systems Charm for details.
• Shatter Glass: Flexing its will, the spirit breaks all the
glass in the area. The Storyteller rolls the spirit’s Gnosis,
difficulty 6. The base shatter area is roughly 10 yards,
and each success makes the affected area 10 yards larger.
Costs no Essence.
• Solidify Reality: A Charm for Stasis spirits only, this
power allows the entity to spin a Pattern Web, bringing
a choking form of order to its surroundings. With a
successful Willpower roll, the spirit may craft a spiritual
wall so thick that no method short of high-powered
Entropy or Spirit magick can bring it down. The difficulty
of that roll depends on how large, thick, and potent the
Pattern Web will be; a small boost for existing Stasis
would be 5 or 6, whereas a vast web spun across a chaotic
place would be 9 or 10. The Essence cost also depends
upon the difficulty of that Web’s construction – from
one for a small and simple Web to 20 for a large and
static barrier. For other details (including the use of a
Pattern Web as a weapon), see the Calcify Charm entry.
• Soul Reading: A common trick for demonic or
aristocratic entities, this Charm allows the spirit a
brief but revealing glimpse of a mortal’s passions and
temperament. It’s not mind reading, per se, but a fairly
accurate gauge of who a mortal is, what she wants, and
how she feels in that moment. Costs three Essence.
• Spirit Away:The awful talent of Paradox entities and other
dreaded spirits, this Charm allows the spirit to snatch a
creature or character from the material world and then
bring him to its personal Realm. For 25 Essence and four
or more successes on a Willpower roll, difficulty 7, the
entity can grab someone; if that grab succeeds, the spirit
and its prisoner go directly to that spirit’s Realm – no stops
in between. The very next turn, both beings wind up in
the Realm. The prisoner can try to escape, of course, but
unless she manages to counter the grab with a successful
dodge, she’s goin’ down… or up… or wherever…
• Spirit Static: A spirit of order and Stasis can raise the
local Gauntlet rating by one level with this Charm. Up
to three entities can cooperate on this task, raising the
Gauntlet by three. To harden the Gauntlet, the Static
spirits must focus on the task, lowering all of their dice
pools by two for the duration of the static effect. This
Charm costs no Essence, only concentration.
• Swift Flight: By spending one point of Essence per turn,
the spirit can fly at three times its normal speed, up to
([60 + Willpower] x 3) yards or meters per turn.
• System Havoc: A Charm employed by Digital Web spirits
and electronic elementals, this power allows a spirit toChapter Nine: Dramatic Systems 495
wreak havoc on electrical energies, causing most sorts of
non-magickal equipment to short out, burn out, or even
explode. For two Essence, the spirit can disrupt fragile
electrical systems (radios, computers, lights, etc.) With
five Essence, it can fry any small electrical system that’s
not designed or protected with hypertech. And with 10
Essence, it can disrupt (and probably destroy) electronic gear
that is protected with hypertech, or else cause widespread
damage in massive electrical systems, like city power grids.
• Terror: Through awesome majesty or horrific appearance,
the spirit invokes a primal, screaming fear. Mortals and
other spirit beings confronted with this entity and its Charm
must make Willpower rolls, difficulty 7, or else tremble
with soul-deep terror. (If the roll fails, the character is at
minus three dice to all dice pools if she tries to act; she
succumbs to headlong flight if she can manage to run or
fly away from the spirit.) A botch on the Willpower roll
reduces the target to weeping, fetal panic. The charm costs
three Essence to activate. By spending 10 Essence instead,
the entity can raise that Willpower roll’s difficulty to 9,
force everything that fails that roll to collapse in fear, and
subtract three dice from even the targets who do make the
roll. For even nastier effects of this Charm on unfortunate
characters, see Things Man Was Not Meant to Know
under Part III: Health and Injury.
• Track: For five Essence, the entity can track a certain
being, without error, throughout the Otherworlds.
Certain beings might not be willing or able to enter
certain Realms (say, a demon faced with a heaven),
but beyond that, the target of this Charm shines like a
beacon to the pursuing spirit.
• Umbral Storm: Summoning an Otherworldly storm
(often like a hurricane, but possibly much weirder than
that…), the spirit invokes high winds (40 mph) and driving
rains. This being the Umbra, those rains might be blood,
frogs, Skittles, or some other cascading material. For five
Essence, the storm covers roughly a mile in diameter;
for every two additional Essence points spent, that spirit
can increase the winds by 10 mph or the storm’s size by
10%. A favored trick for elementals and storm spirits,
this Umbral tempest lasts until it blows over naturally.
• Umbraquake: This shattering Charm shakes the local
Umbrascape with such force that everyone standing
within its range (roughly a half mile) suffers half the
spirit’s Rage in bashing damage each turn, either from
the shaking ground or from collapsing structures, falling
trees, and other debris. Each turn’s worth of quake costs
five Essence. A flying character is, of course, immune to
the damage, though perhaps not from the sound- and
shockwave of the quake.
• Updraft: A potent gust of wind lifts human-sized
creatures into the air. The Storyteller rolls the spirit’s
Willpower against difficulty 6; for each success, the
spirit can lift one creature of roughly 300 pounds or

• Waves: This elemental spirit Charm creates strong
currents on or under the surface of bodies of water.
Churning waters to froth, the spirit can swamp boats,
drown swimmers, and send waves crashing against shores
or vessels. Such applications cost five Essence to affect a
50 foot radius, and the effects last roughly five minutes
for each five Essence spent.
