Examples: You stutter at inopportune moments; tires go flat and warning lights go on when you depend upon your car; expensive clothes wind up ruined by stupid accidents. o (3 points) Chronic misfortune. Examples: Tools break when you use them; children fear you; red lights slow you down whenever you absolutely, positively need to be somewhere on time. o (4 points) Major problems arise. Examples: People dislike you on principle; your greatest plans collapse for no predictable reason; your bank account keeps suffering unexpected withdrawals from sources that aren't you. o (5 points) Pervasive bad luck. Examples: Your endeavors inevitably fail; tech never works the way it's supposed to function; chronic pain or poor health sap whatever vitality you possess. The Storyteller determines the eventual effects of your curse, as well as the methods you might use to lift it.

Maybe the air quivers with strange vibrations, or music plays without a visible source, or shadows gather in your presence. It could be that Resonance has marked you in noticeable ways... or perhaps your own beliefs send out vibrations too strong to ignore. Some curse or blessing might have marked you for favor or damnation. This Flaw fits in well with certain Backgrounds (Blessing, Destiny, Influence, Totem), and can be used as a simple rule system for Resonance if your group doesn't want to employ the optional rules associated with that phenomenon - see Chapter Ten, (pp. 560-561). In this case, one point in the Flaw could reflect a single dot in Resonance, with more points reflecting more points in that Trait. The flaw, under these circumstances, could go up and down; the player, however, gets freebie points only for the level of the Flaw at the beginning of the chronicle, and so the number of freebie points involved does not go up or down unless the character loses the Echoes Flaw completely. As with other variable-cost Merits and Flaws, the different levels reflect increasing degrees of effect, their specific phenomena depending upon the mage and her overall temperament. The following five-level spectrum could complement the five dots of the Resonance/ Synergy Trait described in Chapters Six and Ten, showing the severity of the effects associated with really high levels of Resonance or Synergy. o (1 point) Slight manifestations of no real consequence: perhaps your shadow flickers, milk sours in your presence, or a vague scent that's appropriate to your nature follows in your wake. o (2 points) Mild echoes cause noticeable effects: animals shy away from you or follow you around; you send out vibes that a sensitive person can notice; you feel profoundly uncomfortable around energies, symbols, locations, or people who're opposed to your kind. o (3 points) People who know what to look for recognize you on sight... not simply as a mage, but as the sort of mage you are: plants bloom or wither in your presence; sounds or music echo through the air; holy or unholy symbols repulse you (possibly forcing you to make a Willpower roll to remain nearby). o (4 points) You stand out in ways that even Sleepers notice: your shadow moves of its own accord; you don't cast reflections in mirrors or liquid; cold winds blow even in a still room. People who know traditional folklore might be able to disrupt your magicks if they know the proper legendary precautions to take, essentially performing countermagick with a successful Intelligence + Occult roll (difficulty is the targeted mage's Arete Trait +3). o (5 points) Reality shifts when you're around, rippling with paranormal energies: animals adore you or run away when you approach; people feel sick or energized when you stand near; environmental shifts - rain, cold, shadows, warmth, etc. - radiate outward from you. A person who knows the proper folklore can try to attack or repel you using traditional charms or counterspells, inflicting one lethal health level of damage for each success they win in a contested Willpower roll against you. CHANGELING: Your connection to the Dreaming is strong. Because of this powerful connection, you're more susceptible to the tales of things which traditionally affect faeries. Although Echoes is purchased as a Flaw, it often has a beneficial side effect. The points received with this Flaw reflect the level of your connection to the Dreaming and even to Arcadia. The effects of this Flaw are cumulative. A character with a five-point Flaw also suffers the setbacks of the two through four-point Flaws. See below for some suggestions and examples of this flaw's effects.",

        "name": "Impediment",
        "description": "Due to some physical condition, you're less able to deal with certain situations than most other people seem to be able to do. And if all of that sounds very conditional, that's because the specifics of this Flaw depend a lot on the following circumstances: _ What sort of condition you have. _ How much it gets in your way. _ Whether or not other people can tell that it gets in your way. Literally speaking, an impediment interferes with your path by 'blocking your feet.' System-wise, this Flaw reflects any sort of impairment that's based in your character's physical situation. That includes neurological and internal chemical conditions like autism, dyslexia, chronic fatigue, significant allergies, and other maladies that may be 'invisible' to others but which are rooted in the physical body, as opposed to in the psyche or the spirit. Such conditions might be linked to psychological and /or spiritual health too; those elements are interrelated, of course. For the purposes of this Flaw, however, an Impediment is something that hampers the character's ability to function in the physical realm. Story-wise, an Impediment can be any body-based condition - obvious or not - that interferes with your character's ability to do stuff. Examples of obvious Impediments include a missing limb, a limp, a bent spine, missing teeth, heavy scarring, deformed features, and the like, while 'invisible' Impediments would include chronic pain and /or fatigue, poor eyesight, asthma, internal tumors, sensory processing disorders, and so forth. The more that condition impedes your character, the more this Flaw is worth: _ (1 point) Like chronic headaches, impaired vision, minor arthritis or a few missing teeth, the Impediment presents occasional inconveniences but is not a major hassle in your life unless something worsens the condition or removes the things (glasses, dentures, pain reliever) that you use to compensate for it. _ (2 points) As with dyslexia, high-functioning Asperger's syndrome, chronic fatigue or pain, poor or deteriorating eyesight, or other internal obstacles, your Impediment presents constant but not insurmountable problems. In certain situations, you may suffer a +1 to difficulties that deal with that element of your life. _ (3 points) Your Impediment - severe migraines, significant autism, allergies or asthma, missing fingers or an eye, near-deafness, palsy, Tourette's syndrome, deteriorating limb(s), and so forth - significantly impairs several elements of your everyday life. System-wise, you add +1 to difficulties related to your Impediment. _ (4 points) An inescapable Impediment - missing limb, profound deafness or autism, near-blindness, malformed bones or connective tissues (as with EDS, mentioned above), severe arthritis, gnarled hands or feet, and similar obstacles - forces you to try working around that condition on a daily basis. Under most circumstances, you add +2 to difficulties related to that Impediment, and certain situations (like a nasty allergic reaction) might damage your health and endanger your life. _ (5 points) Thanks to a profound physical condition - partial paralysis, constant and severe pain, advanced cancer, the inability to hear or speak, muscular-skeletal deterioration, major sight-loss, and other maladies - you're unable to function in most ways that people take for granted. Add +2 to physical difficulties unless you've got a reliable way to compensate for that handicap, and assume that you simply cannot do certain things at all. _ (6 points) For whatever reasons, your condition is so advanced and severe that you need major work-arounds in order to function in the everyday world. Many physical feats are beyond you, and you add +2 or even +3 to difficulties of things you can do but only with a major effort. The Flaw reflects practical impairment in the character's life; if your mage has a cybernetic arm that acts like his original arm only better, then that character is not impaired until or unless that arm breaks down. If someone cures this condition with magick or some other treatment, then the character loses this Flaw. All forms of Impediment are not created equal, and so one 'blind' person can function in the seeing world better (that is, with fewer points in the Flaw) than another visually-impaired person (with more points in the Flaw) can do. The Impediment's value may also reflect several different conditions that, taken together, impede that character's ability to function 'normally' more than any single condition does. As an example, this author has dyslexia, dyscalculia, poor vision, and two chronically injured knees; does this stop him? No. Does it slow him down in certain respects? It sure does, and so the total of his 'Flaw' would reflect the amount of difficulty that these conditions, all told, present in daily life. This Flaw serves as a catch-all for previously published Physical Flaws like Blind, Deaf, and especially the pejorative Lame. Unlike many of the labels applied to such 'handicaps,' the Impediment Flaw does not carry any form of judgment on the part of the game itself; although characters (and players) might think less of a 'lazy' person with five points in Impediment due to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, the Flaw itself is not intended in any way to be an insult against people with such conditions. On that note, an unobvious Impediment may present significant social challenges; a person with Tourette's Syndrome may seem perfectly healthy even as her brain misfires, with the only visible symptoms being 'inappropriate' sounds or actions. (See the Mental Flaw: Inappropriate, p. 46) That mage with CFS could be considered 'too lazy to get out of bed' by people who don't see her body sabotaging her from the inside out. And so, the value of the Flaw - with the Storyteller's approval - might reflect a penalty to social-based rolls instead of physical ones in certain situations. ('Why weren't you at work again?' 'I couldn't take ten steps without falling over.' 'Yeah, right...') Note: if your impediment falls under another Flaw, such as Allergic, Blind, Mute, etc. take that Flaw instead.",

        "description": "You ain't as young as you used to be... or perhaps you're a little too young. The years have taken their toll on your physical capacities, and while the spirit may be willing, the body most certainly is not. System-wise, this Flaw reflects the diminished capabilities of a body that is either too old or too young to employ its full adult potential. For every two points in this Flaw, the character loses one dot from a Physical Attribute (Strength, Dexterity or Stamina), either because his body is aging past its prime, or because it has not yet developed to mature capacity. Adolescent characters, obviously, have no such physical limitations due to age, although they could have other sorts of health issues, as described above under the Flaw: Impediment. Previous editions of this Flaw - that is, ones that were written by authors in their 20s or early 30s - maintained that a character must lose one dot of Physical Attributes for each decade over 40. As this author (currently in his 50s, and in better shape than he was at half this age) can attest, that's nonsense. A person can maintain, or even exceed, a young adult's physical capabilities well into middle age, and mages - who employ Life magicks, yoga, and other forms of physical conditioning - often age even better than most people do. Considering that a skilled mage can live for centuries with little (or no) loss of her physical abilities, this Flaw is not bound to a character's chronological age, only to her physical health in relation to that age. Even so, ancient mages can get pretty frail. For health problems related to greater stages of decrepitude, see Impediment, above.",

For the most part, these entities cluster around you in the Penumbra, invisible to mortal perceptions; whenever you cross the Gauntlet, though (either with your perceptions or with your body), they're waiting for you there. Spirits that can manifest physical forms may come across the Gauntlet to visit you, and those that cannot take on physical bodies still energize the spiritual atmosphere in your vicinity. Whether or not this is a good thing for you depends upon whether you select this Trait as a Merit or a Flaw: _ The Merit form of Spirit Magnet draws generally benevolent spirits - Naturae, Lunes, totem and animal entities of the gentler variety, and so on. These spirits protect you from malignant entities, warn you of impending danger, offer advice, help you out when you visit the Otherworlds, and generally make your life easier. Folks who can sense those spirits (mediums, shamans, medicine-folk, werecreatures, etc.) tend to favor you; after all, if the better sorts of spirits like you, then you must be someone worth knowing. _ The Flaw version represents the presence of malevolent spirits - Banes, demons, and other nasty Umbral beasts. Summoned by curses or spiritual corruption, these entities seek to tempt you, poison you, feed off your vitality, and otherwise turn your life into a self-contained Hell On Wheels. Spirit-sensitive folk will avoid you unless they're into that sort of thing, and werewolves will consider you to be 'of the Wyrm' (whatever the hell that means), if only because of the company you keep. Although you might not consider yourself a bad person at heart, your spiritual companions say otherwise! The value of this Merit of Flaw is, as always, based on how helpful or troublesome the spirits can be, how powerful they are, and how many of them you have to deal with when they appear. _ (3 points) Minor entities occasionally offer aid or hindrance. _ (4 points) Minor entities show up frequently, or in small numbers. _ (5 points) Minor entities surround you often, whether you want them to or not, and more potent ones have taken interest in your existence. _ (6 points) You have the interest of one or two entities of significance, and plenty of minor ones pay great attention to you. _ (7 points) You're never alone, even when you probably wish you could be. This spiritual companionship could be directly opposed to your true nature. A really awful person might attract be nevolent entities who want to save her, while a veritable St. Anthony could be plagued with demons intent on fucking up his soul. Even so, such constant presence does have an effect on your overall health. Mind, body, and spirit are interwoven whether we want to recognize that or not, and a mortal who attracts Otherworldly entities has got something unusual going on under the skin..",

Until treated by Life Sphere Effects or medical intervention, the character cannot recover heath levels lost to injury, disease or other factors. At the six-point level, the character suffers a constant stream of injuries even without outside trauma. Whenever he's at full Health, that character loses one health level every two weeks until he is either healed or he dies. As described above, he cannot heal on his own.

Such terror probably stems from psychic trauma, Social Processing, or some other incident that carved its niche within your mind. Although mages pride themselves upon their strength of will, everybody's got their weaknesses; this primal fear is one of yours. The subject of your Phobia must be defined at the time this Flaw is selected. Anytime you're confronted with that situation, make a Willpower roll or else flee that fearsome situation. Even if you do succeed, you'll need to roll at least three successes in order to approach the object of your fears and deal with it head-on.

The Flaw's first variation reflects arcane specialization, the second reflects tech-based terminology, and other variations (Specious Legalese, Obtuse Academia, and so forth) could reflect similar fascinations with other fields. For people who actually understand you, however, the usual penalty might become a social bonus instead... at which point everyone else probably leaves the room and lets the experts talk amongst themselves.",

This could be a rival Hermetic Chantry, a temple whose members consider you to be heretics, a hostile street gang, an opposing martial arts order, a coven that has declared a witchwar against your group, a Construct that has marked you all for death, and so on. This antagonism is mutual, too, and you're expected to act accordingly. Mediation remains unlikely, and things could get worse before they get better... if improved relations are even possible. Obviously, such hostility is personal, with deep roots in the backstory of your chronicle and its characters. Groups of mages don't generally pursue mass grudges without serious reasons to do so! The Flaw's value depends upon the power of that other stronghold and the level to which they hate members of your own. - (1 point) A minor rivalry with an associated Chantry of equal or lesser power in relation to your own. For the most part, the antagonism involves pranks, competition, minor sabotage, and occasional 'friendly' brawls. - (2 points) A significant rivalry (serious fights and slanders, major sabotage) with a Chantry of similar power, or a minor rivalry with a Chantry so powerful they don't consider yours to be a true threat. - (3 points) Deadly antagonism between roughly equal Chantries. - (4 points) A significant rivalry between your Chantry and one that's powerful enough to inflict serious damage upon your own. - (5 points) Deadly hatred from a Chantry that could level yours if they really wanted to... and they probably do. From the three-point version onward, it's pretty unlikely that the rivalry can be resolved without a shared enemy or some significant interference from an even more powerful third party. It might not be resolvable even then. This Flaw requires the Background: Chantry /Construct, but any character with such associations can take it - the Flaw is not restricted to mages from the Traditions and Technocracy. Your rivalry might cross factions, too; a Hermetic House might hold a longstanding enmity with a Progenitor lab. It can also exist within a single group (two rival Etherite collectives), or between two related groups that do not belong to the same faction; alchemist sects, for example, have been arguing over the name Solificati for centuries, with no end in sight!",

Social dice rolls you make while dealing with members from this group add +2 to the difficulty. You cannot, obviously belong to this sect when you first take this Flaw, although you could conceivably smooth things over, buy off the Flaw, and join that group later.

Why does this person hate you? It could be a 'simply business' sort of situation, like the rivalry between Syndicate executives or Hermetic Adepts. There may be a romantic tangle or family history involved, or perhaps an academic dispute, as is often found among members of the Etherite Tradition or Progenitor lab-groups.

That fact doesn't keep people - Sleepers and otherwise - from looking askance at you if and when this mark can be seen, especially since there's often something disconcerting about the way it appears - a third nipple, a red or black growth, a vaguely demonic face or sigil embedded in your flesh, and so forth. Thankfully, you don't have to worry too much about witch-hunters in the technologically industrialized world. (Other regions are a different story; even rural areas of so-called advanced nations still hold people who will harm or kill someone who's 'different.') The mark's disconcerting appearance, though, may lead you to cover it up anyway. Folks who do believe old-fashioned ideas about 'witches' will not take kindly to that devilish brand, so it could become a real problem under the wrong circumstances.

        "name": "Paranormal Prohibition or Imperative",
        "description": "Also known as Geasa and Magical Prohibition or Imperative, this Flaw represents a thing you either must do, or are forbidden from doing, on pain of awful consequences. Generally, this imperative comes from an oath you swore, a curse that was inflicted upon you, or a legacy that follows your family lineage. Faerie grudges, infernal pacts, godly inheritances, ancient prophecies, Fortean quirks of physics... any one of them can inflict such a burden upon you. So long as you never cross that line, you should be okay - and may, in fact, possess some blessing (a Merit or Background Trait) that's linked to this Flaw. Ah, but life has a way of pushing us to do things we don't want to do, and that's especially true in the case of people who have a curse or geas upon their heads! The value of this Flaw is based on your chances of violating the prohibition, and the consequences that occur if / when you do: - (1 point) You break the prohibition only with an easily avoided circumstance (never kill a cat, go to London, or have sex with a married person), or find it easy to fulfill your imperative (you must shave all your hair off, walk outside every day, or wear blue clothing). - (2 points) Your prohibition is easy to break (never tell a lie, leave your home town, or have sex with anyone), or your imperative is challenging to fulfill (you must always cover your head, walk at least three miles every day, or go barefoot at all times). - (3 points) It's very hard to not break your prohibition (never speak, have a home of your own, or fall in love or lust with anyone), or to honor your imperative (you must blindfold yourself every day even though you can see, walk everywhere you go, or remain naked at all times). - (+1 point) Inconvenient consequences - you botch your next three rolls, suffer a migraine, develop a rash for several days, etc. - (+2 points) Annoying consequences - you lose your voice for a day, lose a die from all your pools for a week due to constant pain, add +2 to all your social rolls with members of your faction until you can atone from breaking your oath, and so forth. - (+3 points) Painful consequences - until you can atone, you go blind or mute, lose one dot from an Attribute, lose an Ally, Mentor, or Familiar, take the Flaw: Oathbreaker (below), or suffer a similarly awful fate. - (+4 points) Crippling consequences - until you atone, your Avatar abandons you, you lose a total of three dots from various Attributes, you take the Flaws: Oathbreaker, Deranged or both, or else endure a related punishment. - (+5 points) Fatal consequences - either you're gonna die soon, you'll be whisked off to an Otherworldly punishment Realm, or both. Atonement, if it's even possible, will be very harsh, so do NOT break this oath or forsake this imperative! This Flaw makes an excellent companion to numerous Backgrounds (Familiar, Legend, Past Life, Totem, Wonder, and potentially others at the Storyteller's discretion) and Merits (pretty much anything, really, depending on how you define the source of that Merit). Although this does not reduce the cost of that Trait (despite the description of this Flaw in Mage Revised, which employed a complex and potentially abusive rule system that's not found in other World of Darkness games), a Prohibition /Imperative can represent vows, obligations, and /or legacies associated with the beneficial Trait. If, for example, Riordan Manseragh were to have sworn a mystic oath in order to win his hawk-spirit familiar, that oath would represent a Paranormal Imperative, with painful consequences (the loss of his Familiar Background) if he breaks his promise. Your Prohibition /Imperative must be tied in with your character's backstory, and probably has a connection to all three elements of her magickal focus (paradigm, practice, and instruments). The conditions must be something that could conceivably present an obstacle for your character (no prohibitions, for example, against having sex with Voormas, or imperatives to get out of bed in the morning), and your Storyteller will, of course, make a point of throwing said obstacles in your path at various points during the chronicle. That said, we also urge Storytellers not to abuse this Flaw, or to apply it out of proportion with the points the Flaw is worth. Although it's rather unusual, a technomancer could have a metaphysical pact or prohibition too. She may, for instance, need to work on a Mac, employ only steamtech, or invent all of her own technology to avoid suffering some paranormal malaise. Thus, this Flaw is not always 'mystical' in nature, even if the line separating mysticism from paranormal phenomena is more a matter of semantics than of metaphysical principles.",

Okay, maybe it's not an actual imp - it could be a malfunctioning robot companion, a vain and selfish bioconstruct, a troublesome spirit, an obnoxious beast, that talking winged tarantula we mentioned a few entries ago... the form of the creature is unimportant. Like the above Flaw: Apprentice, this Trait reflects a companion character who, despite being supposedly on your side, remains a constant pain in your ass. Originally presented as the adversarial Background for Familiar, this Flaw becomes more significant as the power of the creature, and its attendant nuisance, grows: - (1 point) A creature of unusual, but minor, ability, which busies itself with trivial annoyances. - (2 points) An entity whose power and intellect (or at least its cunning) make your life frustrating but not actively hazardous. - (3 points) A being of notable power whose mischief has begun to shade into actual damage to your property, health, status, and relationships. - (4 points) A metaphysical pain in the tuchus whose powers cause lasting harm to you and to the things you consider precious. - (5 points) A walking plague of significant power and malignancy. Said critter might not actually mean to be bad, but its effects on your life are inescapably destructive. As with an Apprentice Flaw, above, you bear a certain amount of responsibility to this creature - it's not simply your enemy, or even a nemesis, but a being with whom you share a vital bond. Also as per the Apprentice Flaw, your treatment of this 'gremlin' (a legendary being that sabotaged airplanes for fun) may reduce or intensify the value of this Flaw. A formerly malignant entity could be tamed and eventually become a Familiar (as in that Background), while a poorly-treated familiar might become a gremlin, and a previously annoying gremlin could be annoyed into becoming a serious threat to the mage and his surroundings. As an optional rule, you might even - with Storyteller approval - be able to purchase the Gremlin Flaw in addition to the Familiar Background, to reflect a helpful yet perpetually troublesome companion. A gremlin, as with all other Trait-based characters, is an entity in its own right. Chances are good that the trouble it causes for your mage has an understandable foundation - a reason that seems inexplicable to the mage yet remains perfectly reasonable to the gremlin. A mage who explores the reasons behind this misbehavior may calm her temperamental companion; then again, an attempt to understand the gremlin's grudge might only piss it off further...",

For you, the Periphery remains 'locked' into a single perspective: the glittering clarity of the Vidare Astral, the primal luminosity of the Vidare Spiritus, or the rotting deathscape of the Vidare Mortem. Essentially, your metaphysical perspective is frozen in place. This is literally the way you view the world around you, and that view never really changes. (For details about the Vidare and the impressions they present, see Mage 20, pp. 82, 89, 94-95, 98-99, and 474.) In addition to shaping the way your Storyteller describes the Vidare to you, and guiding your reaction to what you perceive, this Flaw also influences your personality, your sense of fashion, your philosophical and metaphysical paradigms, your magickal focus, and so on. When you perceive things in a certain way, after all, that perspective tends to color most aspects of your life.",

        "description": "Your metaphysical prowess occasionally warps reality in your presence, even when you don't want it to do so. Weird stuff happens when you're not expecting such phenomena, and those quirks of strangeness seem to be rooted in the sort of magick you pursue. A specialist in Entropy could suffer twists of probability and decay; a Life-attuned healer discovers odd growths and mutations in the life-forms around him, while a Forces-gifted mage bends the physics in his general vicinity. These phenomena ebb and flow without your guidance or control. Perversely, the more skilled you become in magick, the stronger these tides of weirdness become. System-wise, the Storyteller determines, once or twice per game session, to roll your Arete against difficulty 6. If the roll succeeds, the Storyteller throws in some random occurrence that's based on a Sphere you possess - most often, on your Affinity Sphere. Grass could grow suddenly, mirrors could crack, psychic impressions could inform you of the sexual habits of the person standing next to you in the elevator - that sort of thing. If the roll fails, then nothing unusual occurs. If the roll botches, however, then a Paradox backlash expels one point of Paradox in your current pool for each dot you have in your Affinity Sphere; or all of your current Paradox, if you have fewer points than that in your Paradox pool. (If, as an example, Jinx has three dots in Entropy but only one point of Paradox, the backlash dispels that one point in a backlash.) These small backlashes won't be terribly damaging, but given the unpredictable nature of this Flaw, they could come at very inconvenient times.",

        "description": "No matter how unobtrusive you try to be, you remain remarkably memorable to anyone who encounters you. You're the very opposite of 'arcane,' which is why this Flaw was originally described as an adversarial Background for the Trait of that name; rather than moving through life with near-invisibility, you stand out like a HIT Mark at a Verbena barbeque. Why are you memorable, exactly? Is it an inhuman glow behind your eyes? An unsettling tone in your voice? A metaphysical miasma that hangs about you despite your apparently mundane appearance? Does grass grow or die in your shadow? Maybe dogs cower when they sense your approach. There could be a low buzzing in your presence, like a chorus of flies, or a disconcerting crackle of electricity that radiates from your skin, disrupting electrical systems in small but noticeable ways. Whatever it is that causes people to remember you, that facet of your presence is a constant reminder that you are not like other folk. Once again, the point-value of this Flaw depends upon the extent to which it interferes with your life: o (1 point) You stand out in a crowd. o (2 points) It's pretty hard to conceal your oddities. o (3 points) People remember you long after you're gone. o (4 points) You creep people out simply by existing. o (5 points) You scare people simply by existing. By its nature, this Flaw represents an unmistakable impression. Each point in this Flaw adds one die to the dice pool of anyone who's trying to notice you, recognize you, or penetrate your attempts at stealth or concealment. (You didn't really think those wailing damned souls were gonna shut up just because you were trying to get past the guards, now did you?) You may, however, attempt to cover up your uncanny presence with a roll of Intelligence + Subterfuge, assuming you have a method of doing so - it's easier to conceal your glowing red eyes with sunglasses than to get those wailing damned souls to piss off for a few minutes! The difficulty of such attempts is generally 5 + the value of your Uncanny Flaw; if, for instance, the clever bioconstruct Victoria Carliotti gets two points in Uncanny for her too-perfect skin, rippling muscles, and impossibly green eyes, her concealment difficulty would be 7. That said, this Flaw does not increase the difficulty of social rolls and may, depending on what you're trying to do, decrease such difficulties instead (Storyteller's option). Despite the potentially grotesque nature of this Flaw, your uncanniness doesn't necessarily have to mean that your physical features are fearsome in themselves. An inhumanly gorgeous or disturbingly ordinary person can be Uncanny in their own ways. This Flaw makes an excellent companion to a variety of Physical Merits and Flaws - Enchanting Feature, Hyperflexible, Hideous, and so forth - and fits in with Backgrounds like Legend, Past Life or Totem quite well too. (See the appropriate entries for details.) Although the Flaw: Echoes can manifest similar odd phenomena, this Flaw reflects a constant and recognizable distinction. While it probably embodies certain elements of your metaphysical practices, it's not tied to your Resonance or activities - it's an innate part of who you are. Your uncanniness could represent physical features (hulking physique, metallic skin, eyes that reflect eternity, and so forth); metaphysical quirks (an unearthly aura, echoing disembodied voices, a chilling radius around you, etc.); weird companions (a parade of pink-winged kittens, smoldering butterflies, howling coyote spirits, or similar inexplicable critters). Essentially, any sort of localized kink in normalcy's tail could be considered a sign of your Uncanny nature. By 'uncanny,' incidentally, we don't necessarily mean 'supernatural.' The unnatural stillness of a Black Suit, the flawless skin of a Victor, the predatory charisma of a Syndicate 'magic man' - they're all examples of uncannily Enlightened technology.",

Perhaps you shrivel up in sunlight, flee from the scent of roses, or melt when obnoxious farm girls throw water in your face. This substance isn't generally fatal to most folks (Awakened or otherwise), but it's potential death for you. Your vulnerability to this substance in question has two potential levels: o Weakening, which inflicts one aggravated health level on your character every turn she's in contact with the substance; and... o Mortal peril, which inflicts three aggravated health levels for each turn she's in contact with the substance. The value of this Flaw is based upon two factors: How common the fatal substance is, and how badly it affects you: o (2 points) You can be mortally wounded by contact with something that's almost impossible to acquire (the sound of Pan's pipes, a splinter from the True Cross), or weakened by a very rare substance (a chunk of moon rock, the tooth from an aged lion). o (3 points) Mortal injury from a very rare substance, or weakness caused by something that's relatively scarce and not obviously harmful (saffron, grave dirt, a raven's feathers). o (4 points) Mortal injury from something that's relatively scarce, or weakness from a common substance (rainwater, silver, a baby's cry). o (5 points) A common substance inflicts mortal injury on you. o (+1 point) You die instantly upon contact with the substance in question. o (+1 point) The mere presence of the substance means instant death to you. o (-1 point) The substance must first inflict damage on you through a typical injury (a stab wound, ingested poison, a silver bullet) before it can harm you. Damage from this Flaw cannot be soaked unless you're wearing an appropriate type of armor to prevent exposure to that substance. (Being aggravated damage, it shouldn't normally be soaked anyhow, but mages have ways of getting around such trivialities.) Your backstory should feature the reason for your potentially fatal vulnerability to this substance. That vulnerability ought to be tied into your magickal focus, too - an Alpha Male tycoon isn't likely to burn upon contact with holy water, although it might be fun to fling a few dashes of the stuff around Wall Street and find out for sure!

It's not simply that you need fuel for your hypermodded Porsche 911 Turbo S - you need your own specially prepared blend of fuels, or the car won't go. A simple rowan wand will not suffice - your spells demand a hand-carved branch cut from an unscarred rowan tree at high midnight on Samhain Eve. In game terms, at least one of the instruments in your magickal focus must be specifically created, harvested or modified to work with your magicks. No lesser tool will suffice. How hard is it to procure or employ this specialized component? That depends on the value of the Flaw: o (2 points) Easy to procure and /or employ (sunlight, yoga postures, motor oil, strong emotions, a book commonly found in the New Age section at your local bookstore, etc.). o (3 points) Challenging to procure, employ, or replace (open flames, the Kurmasana posture, professional racing oil, genuine sorrow, an out-of-print occult text, and so on). o (4 points) Pretty damned hard to obtain, employ, and replace (liquid fire, the Vrschikasana pose, alchemically formulated oil, deep-core grief, a genuine Roman text of De Daemonum Socrates by Apuleius, and other rare and precious instruments). o (5 points) Unique, obscure, forbidden, cumbersome, or some combination of those four (a bottle of alchemically distilled sunfire, an impossibly complex yoga posture invented by the practitioner, personally formulated and distilled hypertech lubricating oil, the heartfelt scream of a grieving mother, a woodcut-illustrated Renaissance Grimoire of Honorius inscribed on flayed human skin, and similarly rarified instruments). When used, the chosen instrument functions as a Personalized Instrument (Mage 20, pp. 503 and 587) - possibly a Unique Personalized one in the case of a five-point component. In your case, however, you cannot employ the magick that's connected to that instrument at all unless you're also able to employ that particular instrument. If Lee Ann Milner depends upon a unique vengeful centipede yoga posture in order to employ certain Forces Effects through her yoga practice, then Lee Ann is SOL unless she can assume that posture in time to deploy the necessary Effects. In the original version of this Flaw, the material was bound to a specific Sphere Effect. This revised version ties the Crucial Component to a tool you employ. This change makes it easier to keep track of the component and its uses, employing the new focus rules presented in Mage 20, Chapter Ten, so that the Flaw becomes an integral part of the way your mage performs magickal Effects.

Does your BCI keep crashing? Do your legs keep seizing up? Is your bioware constantly trying to eject your iron? Whatever the problem might be, this Flaw gets rated by the amount of misery it causes you: o (2 points) You suffer constant disorientation and pain. o (3 points) The malfunctions keep you in such severe discomfort that you need to take specialized medication, or employ other forms of pain relief, at least once a day. Failure to do so costs you one die from all dice pools until the problem is rectified. o (4 points) Your Enhancements fail you at critical times (generally on a botched roll), crash or freeze up, and must then be repaired by a technician who understands the gear you've got. o (5 points) That shitty gear consistently conks out when you need it most. Roll one die against difficulty 7 whenever you employ cybertech in some important way (lifting heavy things with bionic arms, sensor-scanning for enemies, deflecting incoming enemy spells, and so forth). If you succeed, then the Enhancements function normally; if you fail, they fail and must be rebooted; if you botch, they lock up or shut down until a skilled technician manages to repair them. Obviously, this Flaw means nothing unless you've got the Background: Enhancements. Although such glitches occur with Technocratic bioware, they're far more common in cybernetics that have been installed by factions whose people haven't maintained a systemic and standardized approach to human upgrades for the last few centuries. Wonky Etherites and overambitious Virtual Adepts invent crappy iron all the time, and so this Flaw is especially appropriate for cyborgs from those zealously individualistic Traditions, as well as for ex-Technocrats who've managed to go rogue and survive the experience thus far.",

Sure, that paranormal doohickey may possess amazing powers, but it's also a sack of miseries the likes of which few humans can imagine. And you've got one. Lucky you... As with the Background: Wonder (a Trait for which this Flaw was once an adversarial Background), this Trait reflects an uncanny item or device. In this case, however, the 'treasure' is more trouble than it's worth. Perhaps it's cursed with misfortunes, poorly made, haunted by malignant spirits, seething with Paradox emanations, or too experimental for its own good. It could be the earthly form of an unpleasant entity ('I was a thousand times eviler than thou...'), an alien artifact, or the remnant of a culture that passed into dust millennia ago - and good riddance to them! Or maybe it's simply a truly wondrous treasure that dislikes you personally, like the Sword of Fighting in JourneyQuest. For whatever the reason might be, you own this mystic /hypertech millstone, and can't easily get rid of it. Like all variable-point Flaws, the value of this Trait depends upon its ability to screw up your life. In this case, however, the value of the Flaw is deducted from the Background cost of a Wonder. In order to avoid nightmarish catastrophes of math, every two points in the Flaw are worth one dot in the Wonder Background's cost. That cost, however, cannot drop below one dot (two points), and so any points that get 'left over' between the value of the Flaw and the two points in that Wonder are added to the owner's character sheet, reflecting the proverbial dead albatross around the character's neck: a mighty burden he can't just toss away. For expanded rules regarding Wonders, see the section of that name in Chapter Two, pp. 139-165. o (2 points) Your Jinxed item features an annoying drawback that, while not deadly, makes life difficult for the person who owns it. Examples: it attracts ghosts, smells bad, makes irritating sounds at inconvenient times, or radiates a pervasive aura of discomfort. oo (4 points) The Jinxed item has several annoying drawbacks (as above), or perhaps one or two problematic ones. Examples: It must shed blood each time it's employed, has a contentious and unpleasant personality, attracts malignant spirits, or tempts the owner to violate her moral code. ooo (6 points) Your item features a host of annoying drawbacks (at least six of them), three or four problematic ones, and /or a major flaw. Examples: The item belongs a powerful paranormal entity that wants it back, it inflicts constant pain on whomever uses it (three bashing health levels per turn of operation), the object radiates an aura of corruption and decay, or it steadily drives its owner toward atrocities. oooo (8 points) In addition to at least six annoying drawbacks and /or five problematic ones, plus two or more major flaws, the item also backfires if you fail a roll of Wits + Esoterica (or Wits + Hypertech, if the item employs advanced technology), against difficulty 7. The Storyteller is encouraged to get creative when deciding how that backfire manifests; for suggestions, see the Mucking About with Wonders chart, Chapter Two, p. 141. oooooo (10 points) In addition to the previous level of difficulty, the Storyteller essentially has an open license to make your life difficult in unexpected, creative, and often mysterious ways. Examples: A bloodthirsty cult that's after the treasure, a demonic entity imprisoned within the item, a cross-dimensional vortex of probability fluxes and quirks of physics that manifest in the object's vicinity, and so forth. These flaws, of course, should be based in the nature of the Jinxed item and its relationship to the owner. That said, there's no reason that a robot can't be possessed by evil spirits or a primeval artifact can't be a technological hazard using unknown technology.

Maybe you share Papa Ghede's nasal voice and crude sense of humor, or Coyote's grotesquely huge cock, or Christ's bleeding stigmata. Essentially, this Flaw is the flipside of the Merit: Mark of Favor; in your case, though, the mark complicates your life, twists your body, and alerts people who understand the significance of that mark. In certain circles - say, being marked by Satan while living in a deeply religious region - a Primal Mark can be a life-threatening affair. Such marks can also indicate the profound displeasure of the entity in question, like the Mark of Cain (in a non-vampiric sense, anyway) which set the First Murderer apart while sparing his life for a long-enduring punishment. But even if the entity in question likes you, this particular mark is more of a burden than a blessing. If, for instance, you stink like a goat and have the heavy, hairy features of Pan, that's not going to make you terribly popular with the ladies... especially not if you're female to begin with! This disconcerting legacy might come through as animalistic features that reveal your connection to a totem spirit, as described in the Totem Background entry and the appropriate section of Mage 20's Appendix I. (See pp. 326-328 and 633-636.) Or the 'mark' might involve some physical manifestation of your inner Avatar. You could share the archetypal 'look' of a notorious family, like the Borgias or Romanovs, even if you're not actually related to that bloodline; or bear an uncanny resemblance to some sinister beast even if you're not a shapechanger or totem-friend. Maybe you just look like what people think of when they say wizard, shaman, or witch - which, in many cultures, can be rather unhealthy for people so identified. In short, you look weird in the literal, uncanny meaning of that phrase, and people notice. Obviously, you should define the appearance of this feature, and decide the sort of reaction people have when they notice it. Because this is a Flaw, of course, that reaction should be negative in some way - the 'primal mark of the Jolie-Pitt Clan' is not exactly a Flaw unless you're dealing with paparazzi. The 'mark' could also be a tone of voice, a distinct way of moving (birdlike, catlike, Papa Legba-like), or a certain vibe that nearly anyone can sense. Whatever their source and manifestation, these Primal Marks are obvious, and they tend to carry over even when a mage changes shape. People recognize you even when you'd rather not be recognized, and that sort of distinction can be rather unhealthy too. This Flaw goes well with Backgrounds like Blessing, Destiny, Legend, Past Lives, and, as suggested earlier, Totem. It could be taken as a genetic Flaw for Enhancements, or as a reflection of an especially potent Avatar. For extra fun, you might not even know why you've been so marked, who marked you, or what may come as a result of the mark. As with so many elements of a mage's life, these Primal Marks could be mysteries whose answers lay at the end of a long and winding Path... if, indeed, those answers ever reveal themselves at all.",

Your Seekings may involve literal guilt-trips in which you're confronted with the potential (or real) consequences of your violated promise; your Resonance remains tainted by the presence of dishonor; Paradox will assume appropriately ironic forms, like visitations from the entity called Judgment in Mage 20, Appendix I; and should you fall into Quiet, there'll be no place to hide from the transgression you've committed. In short, then, you're screwed for reasons that are very likely your own fault. (Tragic stories, of course, revolve around people who broke vows without meaning to do so, or who were put into no-win situations regarding promises that could not possibly have been kept. The universe, however, can be implacable and uncaring in such matters. 'Fair,' among Awakened folk, is not a common word!) Some sort of penance should be available to an oath-breaking character. She might not know what that atonement is, though, and the quest for such rectification could be the seed for powerful stories (cf. the tragedy of Oedipus Rex). Atonement is rarely a pleasant matter (again, see Oedipus), but the successful performance of such rituals should erase this Flaw... at least until you make and break another promise, that is. For a related Flaw, see Faithless, below. To see potential consequences of oath-breaking, check out the genre entry for Tragedy in Chapter Five's section Genre, Storytelling, and Mage, pp. 285-286.",

Story-wise, you cut yourself, slash designs in your skin, or otherwise hurt yourself enough to shed the required amount of blood. This sort of thing can, of course, add up quickly if you're throwing lots of magick around without giving yourself a chance to heal, as bashing damage soon leads to lethal damage (see Types of Injury in Mage 20, p. 406). Meanwhile, your bloodletting looks pretty gross and obvious (often vulgarly so), and tends to make a mess as well.

Now you're in deep to someone whose power dwarfs your own, and your prospects for getting out of bondage are laughable at best. Haunted by thoughts of the payment to come, you live on borrowed time and realize that the worst is yet to come... Sometimes known, with minor variations, as Faust's Bargain, Bound puts your character in the Faust-like position of getting something interesting in return for something significant - her life, her soul, a thousand years of servitude, or a similarly awful fate that no one in their right mind would want to risk. Still, occultists are infamous for short-term thinking, and literal devil's deals are common currency in the magickal world. The specifics of that deal are for you and your Storyteller to arrange; you might have received some Merit(s) and / or Abilities in return for the debt (purchased with the points from this Flaw), escaped an awful situation ('You want out of this death-trap, dear wizard? Very well - what do you have to offer me?'), saved someone who was important to you ('Sure, I'll bring your mother back from the brink of death - let us discuss the terms of this favor...'), or otherwise blew a standoff with an Otherworldly entity (see the Summoning, Binding, Bargaining, and Warding section of How Do You DO That? pp. 91-95). Like the Flaw: Dark Fate (below), this debt throws a foreboding air over your character's part of the chronicle. In this case, though, your doom may be averted if you can wrangle a way out of this pact. In the meantime, your creditor will call in occasional favors - nothing large enough to pay off the debt (unless that entity needs a significant service and agrees to write off the larger obligation), but deeds that can spark new stories or complicate existing ones. Despite tradition, this debt doesn't have to be a soul-pact owed to a devil - a promise to your god(s) or their immediate emissaries can be just as terrible as one owed to Old Scratch!",

Until you can shake this crisis of faith, perhaps atoning for your perceived misdeeds, your Spheres remain stuck at Rank 1 - potent enough to perceive the presence of Divinity around you, limited enough to remind you that you have failed. This Flaw (which is more likely to be 'awarded' to you through the course of the game than it is to be something you purchased during character creation, though of course you can start off a new character in such a crisis) represents the power of faith in your character's life - a power so strong that it can interfere with your abilities as a mage. Ironically, the strength of that faith denies you the ability to use magick when you feel that your faith is lacking. From a game-system standpoint, you are denying yourself the ability to access your magick because you believe that your magick comes from a source you have betrayed. Your mage believes that his god is cutting him off from magick, though... and, considering that the player is pretty much the 'god' of a gaming character, in a meta sort of way, that's true. Although a character with this Flaw can pursue any sort of spiritual focus, his paradigm and practice must be oriented toward religious devotion. You could be a shaman or a priest, a Goddess-bound witch, a spiritual scientist, even an Infernalist whose hell-spawned powers flow from a damnation pact. Obviously, this Flaw means nothing to an atheist, or to someone with nebulously casual beliefs. Only a mage who believes deeply in some greater power can believe that she has so much to lose from a sudden lack of faith. In order to discard this Flaw, the player must pay a five-point 'fine' in order to buy off the Trait itself, and roleplay out a 'dark night of the soul' sort of Seeking in which he faces his sins and rededicates himself to his divine Path. The character, meanwhile, must first undergo an atonement that suits his belief system and the 'sin' that invoked this punishment. Maybe he needs to take strict vows within a religious order... or take on even stricter ones if he had already broken his previous set of vows. Did he violate a taboo? Then he must undergo ritual purification, often by way of fasting, marathons of prayer, and some traditionally torturous ordeals. A mage who has sworn never to kill, and yet who has killed someone, may be forced to make significant restitutions to the murdered person's family. Traditional atonements include pilgrimages, vision quests, oaths of poverty, appalling mortifications (self-torture, radical fasting, mutilation, and so forth), and other difficult paths back to the favor of one's god. Regardless of the creed and specific atonements, however, the mage must spend endless hours in intensive prayer. A faithless soul, after all, must find his way back to the presence of his god... typically on his knees.",

Your presence consumes vitality from your surroundings and the living things who happen to get too close to you. Unless you do so, however, your own life-force withers. Despite your best intentions, you're essentially a walking void into which life itself pours in order to sustain your own existence. Story-wise, you're a drain on the energy of your companions. Insects and small plants perish in your presence, while children and animals smaller than a horse feel ill when you stand near them. System-wise, any character who's in physical contact with you for an hour or more loses one health level per hour to bashing damage. If you're unable to soak up someone else's life-force, though, then your own vitality drains away. In system terms, you lose health levels in the reverse order that you would heal lethal damage, dropping to Bruised after one day, to Hurt after three days, to Injured after one week, and so on. (For details, see Mage 20, p. 406.) If you employ Life Sphere magicks, your difficulties for healing or improvement-type Effects are raised by +2, while your difficulties with corrupting, damage, or illness-related Effects are lowered by -2. (In both cases, the usual maximums and minimums still apply.) Each health level you inflict on someone else with Life Sphere magick heals you of one health level if you're injured, or else forestalls the 'starvation' loss of your own health levels by one day per health level inflicted. An inversion of the Merit: Spark of Life (p. 78), this Flaw darkens your aura, makes your blood taste awful as far as vampires are concerned, and keeps your close associates constantly sick with low-level ailments. Life-affirming mages consider this to be a mark of profound misfortune or outright evil, while folks who love corruption (Nephandi and the like) see you as a ripe candidate for recruitment. Mundane science can't do a damn thing about this metaphysical malady, and dismisses such fluffy concepts as 'life-force energies.' The Technocratic Union, on the other hand, takes this sort of thing seriously, and tends to view psychic vampires as Reality Deviants of the most unfortunate kind. For a potentially related metaphysical application of this Flaw, see the Chapter Three Expanded Instruments entry Cannibalism, pp. 206-207. CHANGELING: The spark of life is dying within you and can only be fed from outside forces. Plants and insect life wither or die in your presence as you feed on their energies, and any person you touch for more than an hour will suffer one non-aggravated Health Level as you siphon away their life. Those already injured (including those whose Bruised Health Level has been sucked away) will not heal while in your presence. If you do not feed the emptiness within yourself at least once a day, you will begin to die. The rate at which you take wounds follows the progression for natural healing in reverse: you take a Health Level after one day, a second in three days, a third in a week, a fourth in a month, and, finally, one wound every three months.",

        "name": "Phylactery",
        "description": "Your magick, perhaps your very soul, resides outside of your physical self. Maybe you've placed your soul within a ring, a jar, or a wooden doll in order to protect yourself from possession and control. Or perhaps you believe that your wand, not your Will, is the source of your mystic powers. You could have built a robot as an extension of your Genius, or crafted a jacket into which you've instilled the very essence of who you are. The receptacle itself is not important except with regards to its portability. This Flaw reflects the fact that you must have the receptacle before you can employ your Arts. Without it, you're just another Sleeper. Linguistically, phylactery comes from a Greek root meaning 'to guard.' In many forms of classical magick, practitioners would place their souls or life-force within amulets, either as protection for their souls or as portable vessels for spellwork. Orthodox Jews sometimes employ tefillin - often referred to as phylacteries - as reminders of their covenant with God. As a Mage Trait, your Phylactery serves as a container for the 'inner god' that allows a mage to change reality: the Awakened Avatar. How your character views this relationship between the container, his Awakened self, and the ability to perform magick depends on the character's paradigm. A Slavic witch could believe that she has taken her heart and placed it into a hardboiled egg; a mad scientist may use consciousness-transposing co-location theory in order to secure his brilliance in a vat-held brain. The shapechanging shaman invests her soul into a wolf-skin, while a Hermetic magus employs Roman rituals to lock his immortal essence into a golden staff. Your phylactery is probably an item, but it could conceivably be a location (a grove, a garden, a house, etc.) or living being (a child, a bird, a tree, a manufactured intelligence housed within a mainframe, and so forth). The key is this: Your mage must be able to physically access the phylactery in order to employ Sphere magick. And therein lays the Flaw. All told, a phylactery offers a few powerful benefits in exchange for some pretty significant drawbacks. On the plus side: o A phylactery allows you to preserve a part of your consciousness outside your mortal body. That body may be destroyed, but your soul and consciousness live on until or unless the phylactery is destroyed. With Mind 4, you can project that consciousness into another body or an astral form, while a character with Mind 5 /Spirit 5 can place your Awakened consciousness into a new body for you. o If the phylactery is taken from you, or you're taken away from it, you can retrieve it, or return to it, with a successful application of the Correspondence Sphere. The difficulty for this return Effect is 4 if the return would seem coincidental to a witness, 5 if it's vulgar without witnesses, and 6 if it's vulgar with witnesses. (Yes, the usual Paradox applies.) o A living phylactery retains a psychic bond with you, as if you're in constant empathic and telepathic contact with that character. (No roll necessary.) If the phylactery is a place, then you retain an awareness of that place, and can check in with it by using Perception + Awareness, difficulty 6. (For very large areas, the check-in difficulty may range from 7 to 10.) o With the addition of the Merit: 'Immortal' at the seven-point level, your physical body may continue to survive until the phylactery is destroyed... which, if you don't mind going without your magick for a while, could render you more or less immune to death if you then hide your phylactery away in a safe location. Traditionally speaking, that's why many mages make phylacteries in the first place: to preserve their mortal lives indefinitely. o So long as your phylactery remains safe and undamaged, you remain immune to Gilgul and other soul-trapping attacks. Your body may be possessed, but your soul cannot be stolen or destroyed unless someone attacks your phylactery instead... in which case you're screwed, as described below. For details about Gilgul, see that entry in Chapter Four, pp. 218-220. o And if you invest your soul into a place, you literally carry the essence of that place within yourself, while a part of you always remains there. For practitioners of certain ancestral forms of magic (or simply for hardcore romantics), that's a very powerful reason to do such a thing. Those are the good points. The downsides are as follows: o If the phylactery gets destroyed, your ability to use magick in this life gets destroyed along with it. o You cannot perform magick or recharge your Avatar unless you have some form of physical connection to your phylactery. That form could involve a physical gateway to virtual contact, as with a computer that accesses a mainframe, but you still need that gateway in order to reach a distant phylactery. (Yes, you may use Correspondence Sphere magick to reach the phylactery, and you are always counted as being one success away from your phylactery when you use Correspondence to reach out to it.) o If your phylactery is a place, you must be in that place in order to employ the Spheres. If it's a living thing, then that character has got to be within touching range before you can use the Spheres. (Explains a lot about Blofeld and his cat, doesn't it?) o If you're using your phylactery to cast magick, you need to be rather obvious about it - shouting commands to your hypertech robot pal, holding your mystic crown aloft, hewing your demonic sword through enemies as you shout invocations to your patron god, that sort of thing. o If your Avatar communicates to you through an embodied phylactery character, then you need to purchase the Merit: Manifest Avatar (p. 71) to represent the Avatar's physical form. o If your phylactery is an item, then it's considered a unique personalized instrument, as per the rules in Mage 20, pp. 587-588. It can be broken, stolen or repaired, but cannot be replaced if it's totally destroyed. Creating a phylactery of this sort demands high-level magick - Correspondence 5 /Prime 5 /Spirit 5 /Mind 4 to be exact, plus Matter 4 to invest one's self into a material item, Life 5 to invest it into a living thing, and Life 5 /Matter 4 in order to instill it into a place with an active biosphere - a forest or lake, as opposed to a bare room or large metal box. (A previous description of the phylactery investment ritual, given in the sourcebook Dead Magic, p. 112, stated that only Spirit 3 was necessary for investment; by the rules, however, this claim is incorrect. You need Correspondence 5 to forge so powerful a connection, Prime 5 to invest that intimate a degree of vital energy, Spirit 5 to bind the Awakened Avatar spirit into a separate place or being, and Mind 4 to project an aspect of consciousness out of the body and into a separate vessel. Spirit 3 alone does none of these things.) Unless your mage is already a Master of the appropriate Spheres, this Flaw assumes that some stronger power invested (or trapped) your Avatar and consciousness into that phylactery for you. According to some practices, a magical practitioner must create a phylactery in order to use their most potent Arts; although that's not true in the greater scheme of Mage, that doesn't mean people don't still believe that it is.",

Your spirit has been corrupted - possibly since birth, as with the reborn Nephandi known as widderslainte - and you are, as the werewolves put it, 'of the Wyrm' whether you wish to be or not. This doesn't necessarily mean you behave in an evil manner - you can choose to resist the evil inside you. On a metaphysical level, however, you bear an innate corruption which tests the ideal of Enlightened self-determination. You may, perhaps, defeat it, but it'll be a hard struggle before you do. (Need we mention the Tragedy section again? I guess we just did.) From a story perspective, this Flaw could come from demonic possession, the aftermath of an awful Quiet or a badly botched high-level Seeking, corrupt Resonance, one too many deals with malignant Umbrood, a curse, a vile past life, wicked karma, Nephandic heritage, poor life-choices, the influence of the Wyrm, a collection of tainted texts or artifacts, time spent in a hell, or other forms of metaphysical poison. It almost certainly shapes your magickal focus, and the things you do in pursuit of your magicks (that is, your practices and instruments) may well perpetrate this corruption. (Hey, now, hey now now...) To entities who recognize such soul-stains, you are either a mortal enemy (as far as most werewolves are concerned), an object of pity and potential salvation (the nicer sorts of mages), or - most likely - both. ('Hey, it's a mercy killing, right?') Meanwhile, inside your skin, you wrestle with the urges born from that corruption. Whether or not you give in to them (which would, of course, just deepen the decay), your dreams and impulses hold a distinctly unpleasant edge. Working malignant magick is frighteningly easy for you (-2 to your difficulties, up to the usual modifier limits), but your 'good' spells are harder to cast (+2 difficulty, as above) and have a tendency to leave traces of corruption even when you succeed. Your aura crackles or swirls with leprous stains, and your Merits, Flaws, Backgrounds, and other Traits reflect the damnation you carry inside. A truly epic quest might purge this evil (and buy off this Flaw), but maybe it's just easier to go with the flow, even if that flow leads you straight into the gutter and beyond...

Your nightmares could come from psychic trauma, abuse, brain damage, Quiet, Paradox, Social Processing, encounters with Things Man Was Not Meant to Know, or other things that mess with your head. Whatever their source, these nocturnal hellrides affect your waking life as well. Story-wise, these constant nightmares play havoc with your character's mood, sleep, and long-term sanity. (For examples, see the Prelude for Mage 20.) At the three-point level, these nightmares force the player to make a Willpower roll, difficulty 7, each time her character wakes up from sleep; a failed roll subtracts one die from all of her dice pools that day. (Yes, previously published versions of this Flaw inflict that penalty on any character with the 1 pt. Nightmares Flaw. A full-die penalty on all rolls for a day, however, seems out of proportion with a one-point Flaw, and so this book introduces a three-point variation on the Trait. Storytellers may decide to use the older version of this Flaw for consistency's sake.) This Flaw makes an especially ugly companion to the Background: Demesne (Mage 20, pp. 310-311). In this case, the nightmares twist the Dream Realm into a perpetual horrorshow. Attempts to alter the dreamscape are at difficulty 7 (for the one-point Flaw) or 9 (for the three-point Flaw), and the dreamscape will remain unpleasant, if bearably so, no matter what the dreamer does to affect it.

(A seriously harmful compulsion could be considered a Derangement Flaw instead, as referenced below.) Minor compulsions tend to get chalked up to the rationalization, 'That's just what she's like.' If you want your character to avoid a serious compulsion, however, you must spend a Willpower point in order to put off that behavior for a little while. However, once that little while is up (Storyteller's discretion), your character is again compelled to perform that activity... unless you spend another Willpower point... to put it off again for a little while longer...",

A harmless habit, after all, isn't really a Flaw. The value of this Flaw depends upon the hazards of the addiction. A craving for some trivial enjoyment (games, tobacco, social media) is worth one point, but a drive to secure something illegal, dangerous, or both (cocaine, fight clubs, etc.) is worth three points. Severe addictions usually have a sense of moral wrongness about them as well, and they can cause social difficulties beyond the financial, legal, and physical and/or psychological costs of the habit. The Flaw might come from any source - Ecstatic practices, psychological neurosis, physical compulsion, and so forth - that inspires deep-seated attachment to something troublesome. Vampire: One of your vices from life has carried over into your unlife. Now, whenever you feed, you must also satiate your addiction.

Anxiety, aversions, phobias, sudden rage... whatever the symptoms might be, this post-traumatic stress disorder acts as a protective shield against further harm. Unlike a derangement, this Flaw doesn't induce delusions - your character remains lucid enough. Still, her fears kick in at difficult, sometimes unpredictable, times, undermining every attempt at whatever passes for a normal life in the Awakened world. As usual, the different levels of this Flaw manifest in various levels of severity: - (2 points) Your PTSD conjures occasional nightmares and anxieties under certain rare circumstances (confronting ghosts, dealing with demons, entering the wilderness, and so forth). - (3 points) The trauma triggers phobias or other strong reactions to more common situations (dealing with elders, facing financial difficulty, etc.). - (4 points) Reactions become more extreme - near-panic, powerful aversion, rapid mood swings - and provocations become more common (gunshots, confrontations, raised voices, etc.). - (5 points )Your PTSD kicks off major reactions - fight- or-flight panic, vivid flashbacks, moments of stark terror, incapacitating catatonia - in fairly common situations (sex, arguments, financial transactions, etc.). Even without the specific stimulus, you suffer from nightmares, social anxieties, fear of common things, and other circumstances that could evoke the traumatic event(s). Sadly common in the World of Darkness, PTSD reflects deep-seated pain caused by things that a person might not even recall. Combat, torture, accidents, poverty, sexual violation, domestic violence, parental abuse... anything that can destroy a person's sense of safety might cause PTSD. Despite its sometimes extreme nature, PTSD is a perfectly rational response to harm. Because of that, it can be difficult to treat successfully, even with advanced psychiatry or Mind-based magicks. In most cases, a person suffering from PTSD simply learns to live with the symptoms and avoid the triggers that can set off a reaction.",

Maybe you smell bad regardless of your state of hygiene, possess the proverbial 'evil eye,' have an especially grating voice, suffer from a pervasive skin condition, or have a similarly repugnant physical characteristic. Perhaps the mere presence of you makes people's skins crawl even though there's nothing discernibly ugly about you. In any case, this feature discourages folks from sticking around much. Essentially the inverse of the Merit: Enchanting Feature, this Flaw represents a concealable yet disconcerting element of your physical presence. Unlike Impediment, this Feature affects the way people regard you, not the way your body functions. That said, you could take both Flaws together, in order to reflect a physically debilitating condition that has socially awkward effects as well. The feature in question doesn't represent overall ugliness, as per Monstrous and Horrific, below; instead, it manifests as a single unpleasant physical distinction. System-wise, this Flaw adds a +2 difficulty modifier to Social-Trait rolls whenever this feature comes into play. Story-wise, this Flaw renders you physically distinctive unless you make an effort to hide the Repulsive Feature. If you change shape, that feature carries over into your other forms, which interferes with disguise attempts. If the feature transcends visual senses (like, for example, an unpleasant odor or grating voice), it might betray your presence even if you can't be seen. In both cases, this Flaw penalizes your rolls for physical concealment the same way it penalizes your social interactions. As some consolation, the feature could be used to deliberately frighten or irritate people; in that case, the usual penalty becomes a -2 to your difficulty instead. A Repulsive Feature that has been integrated into your magickal focus (again, for instance, the 'evil eye') offers the same instrumental benefits described under Enchanting Feature, with the same potential for mutilation and a greater incentive for someone to mess you up!",

Thoughts or images wind up caught in mental loops, and you occasionally find yourself tripping over words, getting stuck in patterns of speech, or repeating apparently uncontrollable activities (flapping your hands, shaking your head, rubbing your wrists, and so forth) which, under most circumstances, would be easy to stop or manage. Sometimes known as perseveration or stimming (see the Merit: Hyperfocus), these mental tics often manifest from brain damage, emotional trauma, intense stress, and /or autism and other sensory-processing conditions. Conventionally and incorrectly called 'nervous habits,' these mental quirks may be attempts to control your apparently chaotic surroundings by giving your brain something that feels like you can control it. Problem is, you essentially have to shake yourself out of the locked pattern, concentrate on a new sensation in order to break the loop, invoke a sort of 'ritualized' word or action that triggers a break in that loop, or employ some other method to break free of the mental lock. Until that point, you could find yourself stuttering even though you don't have a speech impediment, feel 'frozen' on words or thoughts you can't easily articulate, lock into near-obsessive ruminations on nonsense phrases or perilous thoughts, get stuck doing the same thing over and over again, or otherwise wind up focused on an internal feedback cycle. System-wise, the Storyteller will occasionally drop small but annoying quirks into your character's ability to speak, suggest small, repetitious actions for your character to perform, and otherwise screw with your character's capacity to move beyond a single nagging thought. To break those mental locks, you'll need to roll your character's Willpower against difficulty 7, spend a temporary point of Willpower, or else stand around 'locked up' in mid-thought or action until you can break that irritating mental block through force of will or (after five turns) the simple passage of time.",

Whenever you happen to be doing something that probably won't result in criminal charges or immediate death, make a Willpower roll to resist the urge to go whole-hog. The difficulty for the roll depends on the likely consequences of excess; taking little risks means difficulty 8 or 9, while risks with life-threatening potential are easier to resist (difficulty 5 or 6)... though you've been known to go too far in that department, too!",

Okay, maybe you don't make your feelings obvious, but your conviction that those people are inferior troublemakers who are Everything Wrong with the World Goddammit comes through in your actions and decisions even if you say nothing of the kind out loud. Such prejudices determine your choice of friends and enemies, guide your beliefs, influence your politics, and tend to spill out at inconvenient times if you lose your temper. (See Short Fuse, above.) You might end up changing your mind someday, but for the moment, bigotry is the lens through which you view your world... and especially for mages, that sort of thing means quite a bit to the world at large. Despite the conventional (and not inaccurate) view of bigots as raging racists, sexists, and homophobes, supposedly liberal people can be bigots too; the worst kinds of bigots, in fact, are often self-righteous folks whose claims of open-mindedness get undercut by a quiet yet implacable prejudice against those people. Older versions of this Flaw rated it at only two points; in the twenty-first century, however, bigotry is more likely to get you in trouble if and when it's revealed, especially on the Internet or in mass media... unless, of course, you're running for president, or otherwise speaking up for folks who share your views, in which case you become a saint to some people and a demon to others. It's worth noting that bigots tend to have understandable reasons for their prejudices. Those reasons could stem from personal grievances, cultural bias, racial anxieties, scriptural proclamations, psychic trauma, gender clashes, philosophical paradigms, and - especially within Mage's world - physical and metaphysical distinctions between 'us' and 'them.' Those reasons probably seem like bullshit to most people, but remain perfectly justified to the bigot in question. It's also worth noting that this Flaw should not in any way be taken as a license to abuse your fellow players. As with other mature-audience subjects, a character's prejudices might become a trigger for real-life tensions within the group, and should thus be handled carefully, as described under the Problems and Triggers sections of Mage 20, pp. 344-345.",

        "description": "Regardless of your external circumstances, you often feel drawn toward despair. Everything seems overwhelming, pointless, and at best a fucking joke at the world's expense. That feeling pervades each aspect of your existence: your attitude, your physical health, your relationships, and even - especially! - your approach to magick and all its manifestations. (See the Mage 20 sections about Focus and the Arts, Resonance, Quiet, and the Vidare perceptions of the Otherworlds.) TL/DR: It really sucks to be you. Often viewed as a purely psychological issue ('It's all in your pretty little head...'), chronic depression tends to be linked to physiological Impediments, as in the Physical Flaw of that name. This Flaw can also reflect the psychic aftermath of Paradox backlashes, Quiet episodes, Things Man Was Not Meant to Know, Mind-Sphere attacks, and other forms of trauma (breakups, violation, disaster, and the like), although trauma-induced depression is most often a manifestation of the Flaw: PTSD, referenced above. Regardless of its origins, the psychological element of depression is inescapable. The emotional weight of constant despair tends to sap physical vitality, which comes back around and inspires more depression. No wonder chronically depressed people have a hard time 'living life to the fullest.' On some days, just getting out of bed without falling into a crying heap is a challenge. Story-wise, this Flaw influences roleplaying and character descriptions as suggested above. System-wise, it often requires you to make a Willpower roll when your depressed character needs to push himself beyond the depression. A successful roll means that he acts without hindrance. A failed one adds +2 to the difficulty of the primary task at hand, which could involve Attributes from the Physical (depression drains vitality), Social (undercuts relationships with other folks), or Mental (mental fuzz) categories, depending upon the situation. A botched roll means that the depression takes over and drops him into a deep black pit of despair in which he'll be stuck for hours or even days at a time. You can spend a Willpower point to shove depression aside, avoiding this roll entirely. However, as anyone who understands the analogy of spoons can attest, sooner or later you run out of Willpower points. (For those who are not familiar with the analogy, it's the idea that you have a limited number of spoons to use each day; every task demands that you give up one spoon, and so you soon run out of spoons). The fact that people tend to get frustrated with your Black Cloud of DoomTM doesn't exactly help matters much; hell, you're more frustrated with that shit than anybody else is! So seriously - in all aspects of one's life, Chronic Depressiontown is not a fun place to be... not even for fans of the World of Darkness.",

Perhaps you're a throwback, or wild-raised since childhood; or maybe you lost a part of yourself to animalistic shapechanging, suffer from a mental or psychological quirk, or simply renounce your humanity in favor of a more honest primal truth. Regardless of its origins, this feral-mindedness limits your ability to function in human society. You prefer non-linguistic vocalizations and body language over cultured speech, and may lack the ability to 'speak' in human terms at all. Your actions and reactions are animalistic too; you mark territory, snarl when annoyed, cower or lash out when threatened, feel no sense of so-called 'modesty,' detest clothing, and smell musky even when you've just had a bath (which you rarely do under your own power). Such behaviors usually raise the difficulty of your social-interaction rolls by +3, although certain situations - like intimidation or seduction - may lower the difficulty by the same amount (-3). This Flaw, however, isn't simply a social drawback; you may not have more than three separate Language Merits, and you speak very little (and very simply) when you choose to speak at all. Your human developmental skills (speech, reading, math, socialization, etc.) hover at a child-like level despite your sharp instincts and innate primal cunning. Although your Mental Attributes (especially Perception and Wits) may be high, you probably won't ever reach an adult level of human development; even if you do, the animal in you remains very close to the skin.",

High-stress situations can trigger such hallucinations - and since mages essentially live in high-stress situations, this Flaw can be a fairly nasty one. The stress in question doesn't have to be a bad experience, although it does tend to be the bad days that bring such things out in the worst way possible. You might see your loved one's face start to melt in a moment of passion... or feel the branding irons that seared your flesh in a past life burn their way into your skin during an argument with your boss. Heavy traffic could become a roller coaster, and the exam you're taking might morph into a living page of laughing cartoons. Flashbacks don't have to make sense, and they often don't. They can, however, blot out your true surroundings unless you successfully make a Willpower roll (difficulty 8) to shake them off. Thankfully, flashbacks don't often last long.

People suspect you of criminal, or at least unsavory, behavior; the authorities harass or detain you for little or no reason, and your loved ones probably 'wish you could just be like normal people.' Granted, every mage is 'other' to some degree. In your case, though, the othering threatens your life, liberty, and happiness. Also known as Mistreated Minority, this Flaw reflects prejudice within your society. The amount of trouble it causes, and the frequency of said trouble, determines the value of your Flaw: - (1 point) Folks around you tend to harass you in small but noticeable ways (acting uncommonly brusque, using slurs in your presence, taking uncomfortable liberties with your privacy, property or person, etc.) and seem to feel there's nothing wrong with that at all. Other people might stand up for you, but more often than not they won't. - (2 points) As above, but now your family and other intimate companions feel that you deserve to be avoided, shamed, insulted, and so forth because you are who or what you are. - (3 points) Strangers feel free to shame, insult, avoid, and perhaps physically attack you on general principle. Authorities might intervene, but probably won't do so unless major laws are broken... and maybe not even then. - (4 points) Authorities discriminate against you too. Your house may be searched, your job may be terminated, you might be evicted, robbed or assaulted and very few people will care. - (5 points) Merely living in this society is physically, socially, emotionally, and legally hazardous to your safety, your sanity, and possibly your life. You could be imprisoned, enslaved, tortured or killed with little-or-no response from the authorities. Unlike the physical Flaw: Profiled Appearance, this discrimination isn't based on physicality. A character with this Flaw cannot also take the Profiled Appearance Flaw; if your character stands out physically while also being discriminated against socially, simply take more points in this Flaw. Nor is this Flaw tied to any particular creed, gender or ethnicity; while a Wiccan could be a Cultural Other in a town filled with fundamentalist Baptists, a fundamentalist Baptist could be a Cultural Other in a Wicca-based Horizon Realm. You could follow a 'heretical' creed, belong to a 'disreputable' subculture, identify as a sexual /gender /ethnic /religious 'minority,' hold an unpopular political opinion... anything that inspires others around you to treat you poorly and get away with it could be considered grounds for this Flaw. That said, a character with this Flaw must indeed be treated poorly; having folks call you out on an unpopular opinion, or criticize your behavior, is part of the human experience, whereas having cops shake you down merely for existing is an actual problem. In order to take this Flaw, your character must face actual discrimination and attack on a fairly regular and hazardous basis. No, being called names on the Internet does not count, although an intense bout of cyberbullying - that is, doxing, swatting, career destruction, and serious threats to life and sanity - might count as this Flaw, at the Storyteller's discretion. Because Cultural Other is tied to the character's social surroundings, a radical change to those surroundings may mitigate or eliminate this Flaw. A polyamorous person may be discriminated against in one city, and welcomed with open arms (and open legs) in another; if that poly character remains in poly-friendly surroundings, then the player needs to buy off or replace this Flaw. Similarly, your 'otherness' must be either something that people know about, or something that they could find out about easily enough for that element of your life to become a big problem for you. A deeply hidden 'otherness' is a Dark Secret (see below) until or unless it gets revealed. To be clear: This Flaw in no way reflects judgment on the part of this game, its creators, or - one hopes! - your gaming group. It's intended to reflect the ways in which mortal (and, often, Awakened) society tends to treat people who stand out from their cultural norms. Being who they are and what they do, mages often do stand out in ways that can be hazardous to their social and sometimes physical health - hello, Burning Times! However, if this Flaw seems redundant in your group, creates unwanted real-life tensions between your players, or gets abused by characters (or players) who are catching hell for acting like dicks, then feel free to ignore or discard this Flaw.",

You might indeed have the Background: Resources, but the money just doesn't stay in your bank account for long. As a Flaw, these Debts represent a minimum amount of money you owe your creditors. The more you owe, the more this Flaw is worth: - (1 point) Minimal debt (less than $10,000). - (2 points) Moderate debt (less than $50,000). - (3 points) Significant debt (over $50,000). - (4 points) Crushing debt (over $100,000). - (5 points) Overwhelming debt (over $500,000). From the three-point level onward, your creditors will expend a fair amount (perhaps a great deal) of effort to collect those funds from you. Certain creditors, like loan sharks, will start far lower than that. Tactics could range from round-the-clock phone calls and red-envelope letters to lawsuits, repossessions, threats, eviction, and physical violence. For folks with small and /or irregular incomes, the pressure from debt and debt-collection harassment can cause intense emotional and psychological distress... which, in turn, affects one's ability to make money... which deepens the debt... which deepens the stress... in a desperate cycle that can lead to desperate acts.",

The value of this Flaw depends upon the amount of trouble you get into as a result of your anachronisms: - (1 point) You seem a little weird, and potentially offensive ('Why are they not sitting in the back of the bus? Aren't there laws about that sort of thing?'), displaying quirks from a recognizably different past or future that isn't radically behind or ahead of the current age. Add +1 to the difficulty of understanding current technology and modes of behavior. - (2 points) You're a relic of a distinctly earlier age, or the harbinger of a seriously advanced one. The things you say, wear, expect, and believe are disturbingly out of touch with your surroundings, and can present significant problems... especially if and when you hold forth on silly little things like politics, social mores, sexuality, and the law. Current technology puzzles you, either because it's inexplicably advanced or staggeringly primitive. Add +2 to the difficulty of all efforts to understand your current era, including social rolls based upon getting along with people in this age. - (3 points) You hail from a time so distant that the current era seems as alien to you as you seem to people of this era. Hell, you might not even speak English (a common trait of folks who existed before the expansion of British and American influence in the 1800s), or speak your language with an accent and idioms that essentially turn it into another language entirely (think Shakespeare, or Anthony Burgess' novel A Clockwork Orange). Your expectations regarding technology and social mores are wildly divergent, and you could easily get yourself into serious trouble.

As with a werewolf or vampire, you're subject to the dreaded frenzy that turns you into an engine of hot rage. Under intense stress, you risk losing every shred of enlightenment you possess. Driven to such extremity, you let loose with the most immediately destructive powers at your command, and 'vulgarity' be damned! Everyone in your vicinity becomes a target, and the consequences matter to you only when this inner storm has passed. System-wise, this Flaw sends you into deadly rages as per the Berserker /Stress Atavism Trait featured in Mage 20, p. 644. Instead of rolling your Willpower to avoid the frenzy, however, you roll your Avatar rating plus one die, with your Willpower as the difficulty of that roll. If, as an example, young Vyper Trabia suffers from the Beast Within Flaw, with an Avatar of 4 and a Willpower of 5, Vyper's player rolls five dice against a difficulty of 5 when that Akashic hothead is under ferocious stress. A failure on that roll sends Vyper into a berserk rage. Yeah, this probably happens pretty often. Vyper's friends don't stick around for long when things go poorly. (If you employ the optional Resonance Trait described in Chapter Two, you could substitute your highest Resonance, plus one die, as the dice pool for your rage. The roll's difficulty is still your Willpower Trait, and your Resonance plus that extra die should at least equal, if not exceed, your Avatar Trait. In this case, the Resonance in question must be something capriciously unstable - Wild, Primal, Ferocious, and so forth - instead of calm and centered energy. For details, see Four Flavors of Resonance, pp. 136-138.) Considering that the Avatar could be seen as your inner Beast, a character with the Pattern Essence cannot take this Flaw. It's best suited for Dynamic Essences, although a Questing or Primordial Avatar could attain frightening rages too. A berserk mage cannot employ rituals or employ complicated tools; only the most direct methods of attack - magickal or otherwise - will do. Although mages rarely suffer from such grotesque lapses of self-control, an Awakened Ghoul (as in that Merit), a cyborg, a Victor, a Shapechanger Kin (again, as per the Merit), or an animalistic shape-changer could possess such inhuman monstrousness. For similarly bestial character traits, see the Mental Flaw: Feral Mind (p. 52) and the Expanded Practice of Animalism in Chapter Three, pp. 197-199.",

An especially common Flaw among technomancers, scientists, ritual magi, religious devotees, military personnel, artists, executives, and other folks whose philosophies and pursuits demand continual attention, OCPD could also result from various forms of psychic trauma, brain damage, spiritual epiphanies, cultural or professional perfectionism, and metaphysical dedication. As a rule, a person's behaviors grow more compulsive when he's under stress. After all, when it seems like your world's spinning out of control, it becomes all the more important to establish control over whatever elements you can control. When this Flaw is chosen, you'll need to define which compulsions your character has, and figure out the triggers that make those compulsions more obvious. System-wise, you'll often have to make Willpower rolls in order to shake off the need to organize and obsess over the object of your attentions.

The family doesn't have to still be part of your physical reality, but the mess they left behind if you managed to get away from them remains a part of your existence today. As with Supportive Family, the clan in question could be blood relatives, an adopted family, or a family-of-choice you kinda wish you hadn't chosen. The more points you have in this Flaw, the more your family issues interfere with your Awakened life. They could be mages themselves, though that's not often the case. More likely, they're folks who still look for you even in your Newlife, hangers-on who won't leave you alone, sickly relations who need tending (see also the Flaw: Ward, p. 66), kids or siblings (or even parents) who have constant troubles with the law... the possibilities are as endless as the real-life complications that a troubled family can bring.

The more inconvenient the substance, the more this Flaw is worth: - (2 points) Easy to procure, though not as easy to devour (paper, fresh eggs, poop, etc.). - (3 points) Unpleasant, hazardous, and perhaps illegal to consume (rotten meat, swamp water, raw cannabis, and so forth). - (4 points) Specialized, foul, criminal, and /or expensive chow (human blood, custom-brewed potions or meals, and the like). - (5 points) You really shouldn't eat such things... but you must (live humans, toxic sludge, gold dust, highly specialized food-like concoctions, and other similar forms of sustenance).

Merits like Supportive Family or True Love (and Flaws like Family Issues) go well with the Ward Trait. Wards don't have to be human, either - your dog, your cat, your horse... an animal who depends upon you could be a ward as well.

        "description": "Mages rarely move through life alone. And when certain companions - lovers, children, partners, parents, close friends, even employers - depend upon you, that lack of loneliness can become a liability. This Flaw represents a character, or a group of characters, who require constant attention on your part. Your life is a hazard to them, and their needs often provide hazards for you as well. Wards tend to get in trouble, require rescuing, and go digging into aspects of your life you'd prefer they left alone. Is it love that binds you to your ward? Duty? An oath? Family obligations? A job like bodyguarding, teaching or medicine? Regardless of the reason, each ward is an essential part of your life. Their life is your priority. Although Ward characters may have a useful skill or two, such folks are unAwakened people, not mages, Night-Folk, familiars, or other powerful entities. That said, you could take a Ward Flaw to reflect a special bond with a Retainer, a Cult member, or one of your Spies. Merits like Supportive Family or True Love (and Flaws like Family Issues) go well with the Ward Trait. Wards don't have to be human, either - your dog, your cat, your horse... an animal who depends upon you could be a ward as well. You can take this Flaw more than once, to reflect several dependent characters. Yeah, there are reasons that mages tend to avoid having big families! Obviously, each ward is a Storyteller character, with all the agendas and complications that situation entails. This person might not count as a Sleeper witness with regards to your magick... but if you've been keeping that person in the dark with regards to your true life and nature, they could still count as a witness for at least their first experience with your sort of 'reality.'",

The world is actually very simple, and everything falls into neat categories that you can judge in an instant. For you or against you, good or evil, easy or impossible, necessary or not, your judgmental nature causes misunderstandings and social friction as you oversimplify everything. In social scenarios where your closemindedness comes to bear, increase the difficulty by one. This Flaw combines well with other focusing Merits like Code of Honor.",

        "description": "The Shells have left a discernable mark on a character who bears this Flaw. Unlike most Fallen Ones, that character cannot conceal her Qlippothic origins. Anyone who understands the nature of those sinister energies detects the marks of passage on her aura; other characters feel distinctly uncomfortable in her presence, even if they don't realize why. Story-wise, this Flaw weaves threads of anti-light into the hues of the character's aura. Most Nephandi, when unshielded, display crackling flickers of blackness in their auras, but this radiance reveals a more severe condition. Those coruscating threads aren't merely dark, but an absence of light that witnesses can feel (and sometimes hear) even if they cannot see the aura themselves. The severity of this Flaw depends upon the extent of the Fallen mage's travels into the Qlippoth. The further she has gone, the deeper and stronger this radiance becomes. o (1 point) Faint traces of darkness that can be seen only by those who perceive auras. o (2 points) Heavier veins of darkness, plus a minor wave of unease for people who cannot sense auras normally. o (3 points) Pulsating throbs of anti-light in the aura, plus a distinct queasiness felt by those who can't see the aura itself. o (4 points) Bolts of anti-light strobing through the aura, combined with an urge to leave the Fallen's presence as quickly as possible, plus a disconcerting sound of buzzing insects or whispering voices. (Adds one die to Intimidation rolls.) o (5 points) An aura shot through with storms of anti-light, the sound of invisible insect swarms, and a presence that sends most thinking creatures cowering for escape. (Adds two dice to Intimidation rolls.) A Nephandus who gains four or five points in this awful Flaw has journeyed past the void of Daath, reached toward the final three Qlipha, and achieved a truly frightening degree of power. No minor Nephandus manifests such unnerving degrees of Qlippothic essence, and so a mage with that level of radiance is a truly fearsome character.",

        "description": "Passage through the Caul and Qlippoth has ripped this mage's physical form to shreds. Although he can be seen by mortal eyes, and can occasionally touch things in the material realm, this Nephandus exists largely in the Penumbra -- an astral projection potent enough to retain an unstable manifestation in the everyday world. Rules-wise, this Flaw renders the character semi-solid visible but only vaguely tangible. To allow this character to affect the physical world with anything other than magick, the Storyteller must make a successful Willpower roll (difficulty 6 for normal activity, difficulty 8 for fine and careful manipulation). Each subsequent turn after the initial Willpower roll demands one point of Willpower spent in order to retain the focus needed to interact with the mortal world. Visually, the Fallen One looks ghostly; his voice resonates with uncanny distance. In the Penumbra, the character appears and interacts normally with other characters. In order to affect him in the material world, however, an attacker must employ at least two dots in the Spheres of Entropy, Mind, Prime, Spirit, or Time. Raw physical forces and materials go right through him otherwise, and while this might seem like a good thing, the Nephandus remains isolated from physical sensations unless he manages to exert his will long enough to feel something tangible. Oh, he can see, and hear, but the sensations of physical touch, taste, and smell are lost to him. Worst of all, he feels the desire for food and drink, but cannot -- unless he manages to focus his will long enough to consume some, or else finds spiritual food instead -- indulge that desire. He no longer truly needs physical nutrition but that won't stop him from craving it. As with other Nephandic Merits and Flaws, this Trait comes from the essence of Descent, and cannot be purchased for non-Fallen characters.",

        "description": "This Nephandus went too far. Perhaps it was the tides beyond the Caul, or the stress of navigating the forbidden shells and their awful entities. Maybe he spent too much time beyond the Gauntlet but retains his physical form. Whatever the reasons, his rightful mind has fled, leaving mental wreckage with inhuman powers and insights too grotesque to convey through rational means. In game terms, this ravaged soul hasn't broken through to Marauder-like madness, nor is he snared in a state of Quiet, or mentally ill in the normal sense of that term. Torn by his Abyssal pursuits, he's an irrational, incoherent mess -- still a mage, but one who hasn't shaken hands with functional sanity in ages. Instead, he mutters, raves, tears his clothing, rips out his hair, howls at the stars, and generally behaves more like the archetypal scary madman than like someone with an actual -- and potentially treatable -- mental illness. Ravaged by paranormal lunacy, he embodies the shrieking irrationality of the Void. Game-wise, this Flaw renders the character unplayable in any normal way, and so it's reserved for Storyteller characters only. At this degree of unfathomable madness, he's essentially unsalvageable; even Masters of the Mind Sphere can't put this eggshell consciousness back together again.",
