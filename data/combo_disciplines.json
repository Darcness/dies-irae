When Anticipatory Locution is active, the target not only sees whom he expects to see but also hears what he expects them to say. This works for short phrases only, not entire conversations, so an Archon can still trip herself up quite easily if she's not careful. Still, Anticipatory Locution is good for covering small gaffes or for getting around code words and passwords.",

If successful, the target hears the answer he would have expected from whoever he believes the character to be. This power breaks down in long conversation or under in-depth questioning, and it can be seen (heard) through with Auspex if the Kindred's Auspex is greater than the character's Obfuscate.",

The character is not immediately aware of the form she has taken, and may have difficulty carrying the ruse further than the initial contact.
