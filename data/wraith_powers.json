Hung outside a building, the lantern advertises a Pardoner's services; carried by her it illuminates his way in the darkest of places. Each lantern's unique to the Pardoner who owns it, for she creates it herself as part of his apprenticeship (or, more rarely, gets it from a master who knows her well), but most Pardoners favor traditional designs with baroque, macabre adornments. A Pardoner's lantern usually produces a pale, ghostly glow, but may change color or intensity depending on the Pardoner's mood or personality",

If Corpus loss while manifested forces the wraith into a Harrowing, the injury that triggered the Harrowing often leaves a scar that even Moliate can't erase.

Tarot cards, tea leaves, tongue-in-cheek relic Ouija boards, the entrails of rare plasmics: Nothing is too outr√© for the dedicated seer.

Any significant noise, including any use of a Keening art, drowns out this background music (unless the wraith succeeds with a Perception + Awareness roll against difficulty 9), but it never goes away completely. Many Chanteurs also like to travel with some form of musical instrument or instrument iconography - a relic guitar, perhaps, or a brooch in the shape of a harp. These are affectations, however, and are more likely to be found on wannabes and followers of true Chanteurs than on the genuine article.",

Other Arcanoi may sign a wraith's Corpus, but Pandemonium leaves its mark on the psyche. Many Haunters do affect cloaks, greatcoats, or other flowing garments that can billow dramatically on cue, but this is a fashion statement, not a true guildmark. What marks a true Haunter is the thing seen out of the corner of the eye, the disturbing hint of what's bubbling under the surface of the Haunter's self-control.",

Additionally, most of the schools within the Guild (see below) adopt emblems or symbols that have special meaning for them.
