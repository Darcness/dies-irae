Individuals outside your family, including other Garou, may not like you. Other tribes may not acknowledge you as Kin. Most Garou view mages as Gnosis-raiders. They see vampires as Wyrm-spawn, wraiths as un-natural, and changelings as untrustworthy. In fact, you may experience a conflict of interest in walking a fine line between your two supernatural worlds. You find, nevertheless, that there is merit in knowing about both your supernatural and your Kinfolk backgrounds. Supernatural Kinfolk costs four points for mages, changelings, and wraiths. Vampire Kinfolk costs 5 points due to the inherent hostility between Garou and Kindred. Sometimes even family ties are hard-pressed to bridge the gap between the two gestalts. Kinfolk characters created with the standard rule (i.e., those who are not either dead, Awakened, Embraced, or Kithain), may not have this Merit.

A Rote Sorcerer has some specific power that they can perform. This power can be essentially anything, limited only by the fact that they need to have a talent and they need someone who can do it (usually a mage) to teach them. For each purchase of this Merit, the sorcerer chooses a rote, as per M20. By default, the sorcerer can cast this specific rote with a dicepool equal to the highest sphere. In this case, the Merit costs one point per Sphere in the effect. So a Forces 3, Prime 2 effect would count as a 5-pt. Merit. The sorcerer cannot cast the rote as quickly as a mage: they must spend a number of turns equal to the highest Sphere for each casting roll. Finally, because sorcerers aren't affected by Paradox, there is no reaction to a successful casting, but a botched one will result in some appropriate mishap resulting in damage similar to a Paradox backlash. The following options may change this cost: +1: Instead of a fixed dice pool of the highest Sphere in the rote, the sorcerer chooses an Attribute + Ability pool and rolls that to perform the rote. +1: The rote is a specialty, that is, 10s count as 2 successes when casting it -1: Though the sorcerer can do it, the rote is particularly difficult, adding one to the difficulty of each casting +2: The rote can be cast in a single turn. +1: Decrease the number of mishap dice by one.

        "description": "Perhaps you learned magic from a particularly dark cult. Maybe your spirit needs additional energy, beyond your strength of will, to enact magic. Perhaps you foolishly studied under a vampire or from tomes plundered from vampires. Whatever the reason, your sorcerer's use of magic always requires the sacrifice of his own blood. In some cases, it will simply burn away from inside. In others, the magician must cut himself and include it in the ritual. Each use of magic causes an unsoakable level of bashing damage. Furthermore, the Resonance of your magic is likely to be dark, or at the very least, martyred in nature.",
