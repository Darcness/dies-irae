As an aspect of Gaia, Demeter understood her daughter's desire for Hades, but refused to let a powerful spirit remain in the deadlands for long. Eventually, Persephone acquiesced to return to the living realm, under the agreement that she could periodically return to Hades' side, and could return to the Underworld eventually. Demeter agreed to this arrangement verbally, but eventually performed a secret ritual to block her daughter from entering the realms of the dead. Such travel is, after all, counter to the proper way of things. Embittered by her now-permanent separation from her lover, Persephone taught a number of favored Black Furies the secret roads into the land of the dead; these secrets have been passed down by Persephone's servitor spirits and aged Garou to the present day. Technically, use of this Gift violates one of Gaia's laws - 'The living live, and the dead remain dead.' But since it is only used by the most ancient and respected Black Furies, and even then only in the most extreme circumstances, few punishments have come down onto those forced to use it.",

If the Fury succeeds, she enters the Dark Umbra rather than the Penumbra. She can remain there for only a single day (24 hours), after which point she must cross back to the mortal realm (rolling to step sideways as usual) or risk eternal capture in the ghost-world. If the character takes more than 24 hours to return, the Gauntlet equivalent increases by 1 for every 2 hours the Fury remains past the deadline: when it reaches 10, the Fury is trapped and will begin her afterlife as a ghost. She will not become an ancestor-spirit. The dead lurk near places, people, and things that were important to them in life, and they are creatures of almost pure emotion in death. They are still coherent, thinking beings, but are occasionally possesed of a terrible hate and fury toward the living, and may attack without provocation. When not so enraged, they do have most of their memories of life, and are likely to be willing to answer the Fury's question if the two were friendly in life. This scene should be roleplayed out: no dice roll is an appropriate way to describe the character's encounter with a deceased love one.",

Calling on the strength of one's ancestors allows a Get to increase his physical might, wisdom or even sense acuity substantially, albeit for a limited time. These ancestral heroes come to the aid of a Get only in times of great peril, and punish any Fenrir who attempts to call on them without need. This Gift is taught by an ancestor-spirit.",

For each success, he may add one dot to any Attribute; these dots may be split among different Attributes, or all applied to the same one. If the Storyteller believes this Gift has been used inappropriately, his hero-ancestors still give assistance, but then turn on their descendant, permanently removing a number of Attribute dots equal to those they granted.

This last step in the Cycle brings the werewolf to an understanding of Luna's need for the tricksters and the madness that she welcomes. The spirits, once summoned, dance around the Garou in the Penumbra, protecting her from harm but disturbing and unsettling all those around her. They play tricks on everyone in the vicinity; harmless and amusing ones on the werewolf's allies and destructive ones on her enemies. An avatar of Luna herself teaches this Gift, which puts the Garou in her debt — and service — forever. To learn the Gift, the Garou must undertake a great quest in Luna's name, one that may take several game sessions to play out. Once the werewolf succeeds, Luna gifts her loyal subject an understanding of the true nature of madness. Thus, the werewolf makes the New Moon's twisted wisdom part of herself.",

At time, they may rest quietly, semi dormant in the Penumbra near the Garou, although they may occasionally play tricks on her or those around her. They are always dormant during the day. They awaken into full life during the New Moon or at the call of the Garou. To awaken the spirits, the player rolls Gnosis (difficulty 6, 5 if the character is a Ragabash) and spends a point of Gnosis. The pack of spirits becomes active for one night per success. If the werewolf wishes them to go back to sleep, the player must roll Gnosis as above, spending another point of Gnosis and get at least two successes. Once they are active, the spirits play games and vicious tricks on all the werewolf's enemies within a 25-foot radius, pinching, tripping and interfering with them in all manner of ways. This creates a +2 difficulty to all the enemies' rolls and removes two dice from their dice pools to boot. The spirits may steal an object from an enemy in the Umbra once per day. It will only be a minor item of little worth or power, as defined by the Storyteller. The spirits might show their werewolf their prize, or they may not, depending on their whims. If no enemies are at hand, the spirits may turn their attentions to whomever is at hand (save the Gift's master) — even allies are not quite safe, although the spirits harass them somewhat more infrequently. It is the wise Garou who sings the spirits back to slumber when the battle is done. A powerful spirit of Jaggling level or higher, may disperse the spirits for a scene by spending a point of Gnosis.",

Those werewolves who rise to the highest rank amongst the tribe sometimes learn the secret that Gaia imparted to the Great White Wolf after his sacrifice, one that deepens their connection to Her and allows them to be completely aware of their surroundings. Everything about her environment suddenly becomes part of the werewolf's awareness. She can sense the lay of the land, the type and nature of the plants growing on it and what forms of animal life live there. She can sense what spirits are at work in the area's Penumbra. The werewolf also gains some sense of the health of Gaia in that area. In an urban area, she might feel constricted or restrained, while in an area under attack by the Wyrm, she might feel itchy or in pain, depending on how successful the Wyrm minions are. Any Silver Fang of sufficient rank may learn this Gift, but the majority of those who learn it are Theurges. For some reason, members of House Wise Heart receive this Gift more frequently than to those of any other House. It is technically possible for a Garou of another tribe to learn this Gift, but it has not happened in living memory, and no song records such an event occurring. Those werewolves who do learn this Gift are often changed as a result. Many choose to walk barefoot on the earth whenever they can, and show a greater than usual aversion to cities. None of them can actually articulate what the secret is, saying that it is either something you understand, or you don't.",

The werewolf gains an uncanny awareness of her surroundings for a one-mile radius for every success achieved on this roll, almost integrating her awareness into the very landscape. She can automatically see into the Penumbra and may look at both the Penumbra and the material realm simultaneously if she wishes and can step sideways at -2 difficulty. Some Theurges have likened the experiences to what the world must have been like before matter and spirit separated. App Perception rolls made within that radius are at -3 difficulty. All local spirits that are free of Wyrm taint can sense the character's oneness with Gaia and are well disposed towards her. All social rolls are at -2 difficulty while dealing with spirits. This same oneness grants the player an extra die in all rolls, save those involving combat, that occur while the character is in the state in addition to the other bonuses. The Gift lasts for one hour for each point of permanent Gnosis the werewolf has. If the roll is a botch, the pain of Gaia overwhelms the character's senses and Harano cripples him for the duration of the scene.",
