• (6 points) For whatever reasons, your condition is so advanced and severe that you need major work-arounds in
order to function in the everyday world. Many physical feats
are beyond you, and you add +2 or even +3 to difficulties
of things you can do but only with a major effort.
The Flaw reflects practical impairment in the character's life;
if your mage has a cybernetic arm that acts like his original arm
only better, then that character is not impaired until or unless that
arm breaks down. If someone cures this condition with magick
or some other treatment, then the character loses this Flaw.
All forms of Impediment are not created equal, and so one
"blind" person can function in the seeing world better (that is, with
fewer points in the Flaw) than another visually-impaired person
(with more points in the Flaw) can do. The Impediment's value
may also reflect several different conditions that, taken together,
impede that character's ability to function "normally" more than
any single condition does. As an example, this author has dyslexia,
dyscalculia, poor vision, and two chronically injured knees; does
this stop him? No. Does it slow him down in certain respects? It
sure does, and so the total of his "Flaw" would reflect the amount
of difficulty that these conditions, all told, present in daily life.
This Flaw serves as a catch-all for previously published
Physical Flaws like Blind, Deaf, and especially the pejorative
Lame. Unlike many of the labels applied to such "handicaps,"
the Impediment Flaw does not carry any form of judgment on the
part of the game itself; although characters (and players) might
think less of a "lazy" person with five points in Impediment due
to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, the Flaw itself is not intended
in any way to be an insult against people with such conditions.
On that note, an unobvious Impediment may present
significant social challenges; a person with Tourette's Syndrome
may seem perfectly healthy even as her brain misfires, with the
only visible symptoms being "inappropriate" sounds or actions.
(See the Mental Flaw:Inappropriate,p. 46) That mage with CFS
could be considered "too lazy to get out of bed" by people who
don't see her body sabotaging her from the inside out. And so,
the value of the Flaw – with the Storyteller's approval – might
reflect a penalty to social-based rolls instead of physical ones in
certain situations. ("Why weren't you at work again?" "I couldn't
take ten steps without falling over." "Yeah, right...")
Aging (2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 pt. Flaw)
You ain't as young as you used to be... or perhaps you're a little
tooyoung. The years have taken their toll on your physical capacities,
and while the spirit may be willing, the body most certainly is not.
System-wise, this Flaw reflects the diminished capabilities
of a body that is either too old or too young to employ its full
adult potential. For every two points in this Flaw, the character
loses one dot from a Physical Attribute (Strength, Dexterity or
Stamina), either because his body is aging past its prime, or
because it has not yet developed to mature capacity.
In the latter case, a young child (see the Flaw: Child,
above) should also take 4 points in this Flaw, with an older
child taking 2 points. Adolescent characters, obviously, have
no such physical limitations due to age, although they could
have other sorts of health issues, as described above under the
Flaw: Impediment.
Previous editions of this Flaw – that is, ones that were
written by authors in their 20s or early 30s – maintained that
a character must lose one dot of Physical Attributes for each
decade over 40. As this author (currently in his 50s, and in
better shape than he was at half this age) can attest, that's
nonsense. A person can maintain, or even exceed, a young
adult's physical capabilities well into middle age, and mages
– who employ Life magicks, yoga, and other forms of physical
conditioning – often age even better than most people do.
Considering that a skilled mage can live for centuries with little
(or no) loss of her physical abilities, this Flaw is not bound to
a character's chronological age, only to her physical health in
relation to that age. Even so, ancient mages can get pretty frail.
For health problems related to greater stages of decrepitude,
see Impediment, above.
Easily Intoxicated (2 pt. Flaw)
Shit really fucks you up fast. The flipside of Alcohol /Drug
Tolerance, above, this Flaw renders you especially susceptible
to intoxication. Your Stamina rolls to resist the effects of drugs
or poisons (though not disease), as described in the Drugs,
Poisons, and Disease section of Mage 20, suffer a +3 modifier
to the usual difficulty involved. Contrary to popular conception,
this does not make you a good candidate for the Cult of Ecstasy
because you don't control the drugs – the drugs control you.
Repulsive Feature (2 pt. Flaw)
Some physical feature of yours turns people away. Maybe
you smell bad regardless of your state of hygiene, possess the
proverbial "evil eye," have an especially grating voice, suffer
from a pervasive skin condition, or have a similarly repugnant
physical characteristic. Perhaps the mere presence of you makes
people's skins crawl even though there's nothing discernibly
ugly about you. In any case, this feature discourages folks from
sticking around much.
Essentially the inverse of the Merit: Enchanting Feature,
this Flaw represents a concealable yet disconcerting element of
your physical presence, not the way your body functions. That
said, you could take both Flaws together, in order to reflect a
physically debilitating condition that has socially awkward effects
as well. The feature in question doesn't represent overall ugliness,Chapter One: Heroic Traits 41
as per Monstrous and Horrific, below; instead, it manifests as
a single unpleasant physical distinction.
System-wise, this Flaw adds a +2 difficulty modifier to
Social-Trait rolls whenever this feature comes into play. Story-wise, this Flaw renders you physically distinctive unless you
make an effort to hide the Repulsive Feature. If you change
shape, that feature carries over into your other forms, which
interferes with disguise attempts. If the feature transcends visual
senses (like, for example, an unpleasant odor or grating voice),
it might betray your presence even if you can't be seen. In both
cases, this Flaw penalizes your rolls for physical concealment
the same way it penalizes your social interactions.
As some consolation, the feature could be used to deliberately frighten or irritate people; in that case, the usual penalty
becomes a -2 to your difficulty instead. A Repulsive Feature that
has been integrated into your magickal focus (again, the "evil eye") offers the same instrumental benefits described
underEnchanting Feature, with the same potential for mutilation
and a greater incentive for someone to mess you up!
Profiled Appearance (2 pt. Flaw)
You look like one of those people… y'know, the people
that "respectable citizens" expect bad things from. Depending
on the setting of your chronicle, this could involve physical
mannerisms, body art, gender distinctions, individual features,
ethnic heritage, cybernetic modifications, or other elements
of your physical body that you cannot remove and probably
don't want to "fix" anyhow. Problem is, the people around
you are constantly watching your every move, making trouble
for you when they can get away with it, and otherwise causing
you grief. The authorities shake you down on principle, and
most folks won't object to whatever they choose to do to you.
Although it's related to the Social Flaw: Cultural Other
(below), Profiled Appearance is based on your character's
physical features, not on their social behavior. Although it can
be concealed to some degree, your Profiled Appearance is not
something that can be removed without magick, and it reflects
an essential part of your identity. Like Impediment, it does not
carry a value judgment in the game even though it represents the
way other characters will view you. If this feels unfair in the
game, imagine how it must feel in real life.
Degeneration (3, 6 or 9 pt. Flaw)
Your body is falling apart. A curse, disease, flawed biotech,
corrupting magicks, or some other affliction is rotting your
physical form, and although Life magick can repair the damage
to some degree, this degeneration remains permanent unless
the Flaw is somehow removed.
In its three-point variation, this Flaw reflects an inability to
heal injuries without the aid of magick or medical technology.
Until treated by Life Sphere Effects or medical intervention,
the character cannot recover heath levels lost to injury, disease
or other factors.
At the six-point level, the character suffers a constant
stream of injuries even without outside trauma. Whenever he's
at full Health, that character loses one health level every two
weeks until he is either healed or he dies. As described above,
he cannot heal on his own.
At the nine-point level, that Health loss is essentially aggravated damage, and cannot be healed except through vulgar
Life-Sphere Effects.
Obviously, this Flaw is meaningless in one-shots or
short-duration games. It should be taken only by characters
(and players) involved in long-term chronicles.
Monstrous (3 pt. Flaw)
A frightening appearance marks you as an outsider. Regardless of your true personality and temperament, some profound
deformities, scars, body mods or other characteristics fill people
with terror and revulsion. System-wise, your character has an
Appearance of 0, and probably suffers penalties to social-based
rolls to win people over, while getting difficulty reductions
when trying to scare people, depending upon what he looks
like and who he's dealing with.
Permanent Wound (3 pt. Flaw)
Due to lasting injury, Pattern leakage, a Paradox Flaw,
or some other physiological deficit, you suffer from a chronic
injury that never heals. This might be an incurable tumor,
endless bleeding, debilitating pain, brittle bones… the specifics are not important. Regardless of the cause, your character
is always at the Wounded health level; even with magickal
healing, the injury returns to its normal state at either sunrise
or sunset (your choice) every day. Although this wound does
not deteriorate further unless your character gets injured by
some other source – at which point, another four health levels
in damage can kill your character – this Permanent Wound
does not recover to a healthy state until and unless the Flaw is
bought off through a dramatic story-based cure.
Short (3 pt. Flaw)
Whether you're the next Harry Potter or a budding Tyrion Lannister, you're shorter than five feet tall… possibly a lot
shorter than that. In game terms, your character runs at half
the normal speed, has problems reaching certain things, lacks
the physical leverage for certain feats, and probably gets a lot
of shit from people who refuse to take him seriously.
Horrific (5 pt. Flaw)
Well pastMonstrous, you're hideous to the point of inspiring
nightmares. Unless you mask your true form with serious magick,
people and animals run screaming from your presence. Physically,
you're not merely misshapen but repulsive on a primal level – the
sort of terror that sent Lovecraft's heroes over the edge. You might
not actually be a Nephandus or Marauder, but folks who know
what those words mean will assume that you are one. A normal
life is, for you, impossible. Whether due to Paradox disfigurement,42 The Book of Secrets
malignant disease, extreme body modifications (cybernetic, artistic,
or otherwise), severe scarring, or similar acts of malevolent fate,
you look like John Cobb threw up on you, then ran.
System-wise, this Flaw inflicts a +3 difficulty modifier to any
social roll that involvesnotscaring the shit out of people, and lowers
the difficulty by -3 if you are. Your Appearance Trait is stuck below
zero, and faint-hearted or weak-willed Storyteller characters may be
faced with Things Man Was Not Meant to Know (as per Mage
20, p. 407) if they wind up spending time with you.
Mayfly Curse (5 or 10 pt. Flaw)
Your lifespan burns bright and fast. Due, perhaps, to
biotech, cloning, or some other inhuman heritage or modification, you age far more quickly than normal human beings
do. While this means that you reach(ed) maturity in record
time, it ushers in premature decrepitude. When you live this
fast, kid, one way or another, you're dying young!
At the five-point level of this Flaw, your character ages one
year for every two months of earthly time (six years of age for
each passing year). At the 10-point level, he ages one year per
week (or 52 years of age in a single 12-month period). Such a
character had best watch out for Time-savvy mages; the Accelerated Youth or Decay feat described in How Do You DO That?
( pp. 111-112) has horrific effects on a mayfly, who suffers six
to 52 years of aging for each year of time inflicted upon him.
As the years rush in, other Flaws like Aging, Impediment,
Absent-Minded, and so forth may pile up on this character as
well. Life-Sphere magick cannot negate this Flaw, which could be
interpreted as a manifestation of the Unbelief form of Paradox,
unless the player buys off the Flaw… and perhaps not even then.
Mental Merits
Mages depend upon their mental faculties. Although vampires, werefolk, and the like prize certain mental aptitudes, most
Neurodiversity and Mental Traits
Minds aren't machines. For all the talk of "normal brains" and "average functionality," medical research and social
activism have shown that such ideas are absurd. In older days, people slapped labels on folks whose mental capabilities
seemed to be "different": slow, moron, diminished capacity, retarded. (Also, brilliant, genius, egghead, and savant.)
Some people cling to those definitions even now. In the twenty-first century, however, two terms have gained preference
over those old labels: neurodivergence and neurodiversity.
Essentially,neurodivergencemeans "someone whose brain-functions diverge from the human norm," while neurodiversity
means "all of our brains work differently, so let's respect our differences." Some folks argue that the latter term is too
broad-ranging and "politically correct" to be useful, while others assert that neurodivergent is an insult which holds
human minds to an unrealistic standard. Both arguments have merit; severe mental conditions do interfere with a
person's ability to function in the everyday world, and it is insulting to call folks "divergent" when their minds work
along different lines than other people's minds work. (Maybe less insulting than moron, but you get the idea.) As of this
writing, neurodiversity is the preferred term among people who want to be inclusive, not divisive, with regards to the
vast range of human minds.
What does this have to do with Mage? For starters, both Merits and Flaws in the Mental category reflect "divergence"
from supposedly normal mental functions. If these traits didn't diverge from the norm, they would not be "merits" or
"flaws." Secondly, both the benefits and the drawbacks originate with the same source: mental capacity that ranges
beyond the apparent human norm. People whose minds work differently than other people's minds work have pluses
in some regards and minuses in others. And so, a character who has, say, Lightning Calculator might also behave
in ways that are Inappropriate to many situations. This works the opposite way too – witness the ways in which
autistic people often Hyperfocus with uncanny acuity. Mental conditions, pro and con, tend to be intertwined. The
conditions that nurture the Merit often nurture the Flaw as well, and so characters with Mental Merits or Flaws really
ought to have both.
Because neurological conditions like dyslexia and the autistic spectrum have physical causes which affect mental
processing, such conditions are considered, in game terms, to be Impediments, as in the Physical Flaw of that name.
(See pp. 39-40.) The ways in which they manifest, though, can come through as Mental Merits and /or Flaws too.
Other, more nebulous conditions, like Chronic Depression, may have physical sources with predominantly mental
results for one character, and completely psychological sources for another. Such distinctions, of course, fall into the
rather Technocratic mind /body Cartesian duality thing, which doesn't really suit the spirit of Mage. To be honest, all
these distinctions are arbitrary anyhow. Minds aren't lists of game traits, either. It really doesn't matter whether a given
Merit or Flaw is Physical, Mental, Social, or even Supernatural – only that it guides roleplaying and affects gameplay.
Technically, all mages are neurodivergent. Awakened consciousness is functionally different than a Sleeping mind,
and can perform tasks (like, say, magick) that a "normal" mind cannot manage. Even so, mental Merits and Flaws
represent significant departures from what the "average" mage can do, and so a character who has such Traits is
functioning on a different mental plane – for better and worse – than the characters who do not. When choosing such
Traits, and roleplaying them out, we recommend keeping that fact literally in mind.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 43
Awakened characters favor those abilities over all else. And so,
it's likely that your mage will have at least one Mental Merit…
and, all things being related, may well suffer from Mental Flaws
as well, as described in the sidebar nearby.
Like Physical Flaws, Mental Flaws make excellent Genetic
Flaws for Enhanced and biomodded characters, especially for
ones whose "modifications" and /or origins remain essentially
invisible to the naked eye. Constructs (Technocratic and otherwise) are especially subject to such conditions. See the heading
Physical Flaws for details.
Artistically Gifted (1 pt. Merit)
The Muses work their will through you, or so it appears.
Whenever you employ your artistic talent (as in, the Talent: Art
in Mage 20, p. 275), reduce the difficulty of those rolls by -2. As
with other Merits of this kind,this Merit does not reduce the difficulty
of magick-casting rolls, but may reduce the difficulty of Attribute
+ Ability rolls that are involved with magickal acts. (For more
details, see Abilities Enhancing Magick, Mage 20, pp. 533.)
Common Sense (1 pt. Merit)
If such sense were truly common, there wouldn't be a
Merit to represent it. Still, you have a gift for thinking one
step ahead and assessing the potential consequences of your
choices. Essentially, this Merit gives you a Get Out of Doing
Something Stupid Free card; whenever you announce an action that wouldn't be especially bright (for example, throwing
a Time-Sphere spell at Old Man Wrinkle), the Storyteller may
ask, "Are you sure you wanna do that?" Thus warned, you're free
to ignore the advice of your smarter angels. Still, you do get a
momentary insight into potential dumbassery, which is more
than most people get. Use it wisely.
Computer Aptitude (1 pt. Merit)
A true child of the twenty-first century, you're especially
adept with computerized infotech. Reduce all difficulties
involving computer-based rolls by -2, up to the usual modifier
limit. This last caveat is especially important when dealing with
computer-based magickal Effects, whose difficulties cannot be
reduced by this Merit beyond the usual magick-roll modifier of -3,
or below the minimum difficulty for magick-casting rolls. Even
so, this Merit provides an edge for mages whose Arts include
the guiding technology of our age.
For detailed optional rules regarding computer usage, see
Computer Systems in Chapter Two, pp. 116-127.
Concentration (1 pt. Merit)
Even by mage standards, you're especially good at tuning
out distractions. When you're attempting some sort of feat that
demands focus (as most do), this Merit eliminates modifiers44 The Book of Secrets
that would be caused by distracting circumstances – gunfire,
thunderstorms, rampaging critters from beyond the stars, and
so forth. Truly distracting situations (trying to hack a computer
system during a tornado, for instance) might demand a successful Willpower roll in order to wipe out the potential penalty;
the difficulty would depend upon the circumstances. For the
most part, though, you get in and get stuff done, whatever else
might be going on around you.
Expert Driver (1 pt. Merit)
You were born to drive like a demon wherever the road
takes you. All of your driving-roll difficulties are reduced by -2.
Language (1 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 643.
Lightning Calculator (1 pt. Merit)
Your head is a calculator of impressive capability. With
a few moments of thought, you can perform intricate mathematical feats – a useful talent for Hermetic wizards, Syndicate
operatives, Enlightened engineers, and other mages who employ
math and geometry in their work.
System-wise, this Merit allows you to reduce the difficulties
of math- and calculation-based rolls by -2. Simple calculations
take no time at all, while sophisticated problems may demand
a turn or more. Obviously, your character needs access to the
proper data before she can work out calculations… and garbage
in, garbage out, so make sure your data is accurate!
For potential applications of math in magick, see the
instrument entries for Circles and Geometric Designs,
Formulae and Math, Money and Wealth, and Numbers
and Numerology in Mage 20, pp. 590-596, as well as the
practices of Hypereconomics (pg. 573), High Ritual Magick
and Hypertech (pp. 578-579), and Reality Hacking (pp. 581-
582). Remember that Merits cannot reduce the difficulty of
a magick-casting roll below the minimum difficulty, or by
more than -3. That said, fast and accurate calculations make
useful aids when you're using Mundane Skills and Magickal
Effects, as described in the entry of that name (Mage 20, pp.
532-534). Depending upon the feat in question, this could
employ a roll of Intelligence + Academics to work out most
calculations, Perception + Academics to discern odds or
geometrical dimensions, and Wits + Academics to belt out
rapid guesstimates with only the roughest of data.
Mechanical Aptitude (1 pt. Merit)
Oh, you technophile, you! Blessed by the machine gods,
you've got a knack for mechanical gear. As with most Merits of
this type, such aptitude allows you to reduce difficulties by -2
when you're making rolls based around working with mechanical technology. No, you don't have to be a technomancer to
use such a gift, much less a member of the Technocracy; still,
this aptitude does suggest that mechanical technology means
a great deal to you, which – by extension – suggests that your
paradigm, practice, and instruments have something to do with
applications of mechanical principles and tech. For suggestions,
see the paradigms A Mechanistic Cosmos, Everything is Data,
and Tech Holds All the Answers in Mage 20, pp. 568-571, as
well as the related practices and instruments and the related
material in this book's Chapter Three. For more practical
applications of this Merit, meanwhile, see Mage 20's section
regarding The Technological World, pp. 458-464.

Acute Senses (1 or 3 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, pp. 642-643.
Alcohol /Drug Tolerance (1 to 2 pt. Merit)
You can drink folks under the table or otherwise party
till everybody else drops. System-wise, this Merit lets you36 The Book of Secrets
make a Stamina roll (difficulty 7) to shake off the effects of
intoxication – a useful talent for hard-pounding Ecstatics and
tough-as-leather Black Suits!
In its one-point form, this Merit functions only for “natural”
drugs (booze, pot, cocaine, etc.), not for lab-synthesized concoctions
(LSD, meth, krokodil, etc.). For two points, however, the Merit can
neutralize the psychoactive effects of any drug unless that drug has
been created as the vector for a Sphere-based magickal Effect. (That is,
say, a pill that delivers a Life 3 /Mind 3 Effect to the person who
takes it, as opposed to an “ordinary” pill that a mage takes as part
of the focus instruments Drugs and Poisons or Brews, Potions,
and so forth, as detailed in Mage 20, pp. 588-600.) In the latter
case, the character needs to use countermagick; this Merit will not
help to counteract such drugs. “Awakened” substances, however
(as per Mage 20, p. 443) are treated as “synthesized concoctions”
even if they are, in all other forms, “natural.
For a more comprehensive resistance to toxins, see Poison
Resistance, below.
Ambidextrous (1 pt. Merit)
The hemispheres of your brain are so attuned that you can
use both hands with equal dexterity. In game terms, you do not
suffer a higher difficulty if you use two weapons or perform some
task with your off-hand. The normal rules for performing multiple
actions still apply (see Mage 20, p. 388-389), but coordination
between the left and right sides of your body is no problem at all.
Cast-Iron Stomach (1 pt. Merit)
You can eat more or less anything without gagging.
Squirming bugs, synthetic goop, a freshly-gutted carcass with
the innards still hanging out… hey, it’s all food, so chow down!
Anything you can physically devour and digest is yours for
the eating. This Merit does not in any way protect you from
the effects of said substances (rotted meat can still poison
you), but you can keep down a meal that would make the
average person puke from its mere proximity… an especially
useful gift if you have the supernatural Flaw: Bizarre Hunger
(see p. 87).
Catlike Balance (1 pt. Merit)
Your sense of balance has been honed – either through practice, magick, or other means – to uncanny acuity. System-wise,
you reduce the difficulty by -2 when your character performs
some physical act (rolling with a fall, walking a tightrope, etc.)
that requires her to keep her feet.
Hyperflexible (1 pt. Merit)
You are what’s commonly but erroneously known as
“double-jointed” (as per the old Merit of that name). In reality,
your joints are exceedingly flexible, perhaps due to intense
training, magickal augmentation, or the medical condition
known as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS – see above, as well as
the Impediment Flaw, below). Whatever the reason, you can
stretch and flex in ways most people cannot.
In game terms, this Merit allows you a -2 reduction in
difficulty for rolls that involve physical flexibility – escape
attempts, contortions, etc. Your character can also perform
uncanny acts of hyperflexibility, as seen in Cirque Du Soleil,
butoh dance, and extreme yoga postures.
Light Sleeper (1 pt. Merit)
Four hours of sleep a night works just fine for you. And
unlike most folks, you can wake up out of an apparently
dead slumber more or less ready for action. You can, of
course, enjoy longer periods of sleep too. But when deadlines, intruders, and end-of-the-world emergencies shake
you out of bed, you get by with cat-naps and the occasional
light snooze.
Noble Blood (1 pt. Merit)
Although the modern world resists the old traditions of
lineage as a mark of quality, your features link you to a powerful family; you’re a Kennedy, a Windsor, a Saud, a Rothschild
– someone whose pedigree is obvious in your physical form
and presence.
In story terms, this Merit grants you the obvious physical
features of a well-known “royal” family: the Kennedy smile, the
Windsor ears, and so forth. The family in question doesn’t
have to belong to a formal aristocracy, either; you might be
a Kardashian, a Murdoch, or a Clinton, and may the gods
have mercy on your soul. On the flipside, your distinct
features might not be especially attractive (royal families are
notoriously inbred), and will mark you out for enemies of
the clan in question.
In social situations, this Merit might be worth a -2 reduction for the difficulty of social rolls that involve people who
care about things like aristocracy, but would also increase your
difficulty by +2 if you’re dealing with folks who hate that noble
family’s guts! In all cases, this Merit reflects an actual genetic
connection, not simply a cosmetic resemblance… which could
provide all kinds of complications when magick and its secret
histories are involved.
While it might be worth some social currency, this Merit
does not in any way provide material wealth or other perks.
For such goodies, see Backgrounds like Influence, Rank, Resources, and so forth in the Mage 20 rulebook, Chapter Six.
For the social benefits of regal presence, see the Social Merit
Regal Bearing, elsewhere in this chapter.
Sterile (1 pt. Merit or Flaw)
For some physical reason, you’re unable to sire or conceive children. Whether this is a Merit or a Flaw depends
upon whether or not you want to sire or conceive children.
Generally, this sort of condition can be easily cured with a
little Life-Sphere magick; in your case, though, it can’t be
rectified until and unless you, the player, discard the Merit
or pay off this Flaw.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 37
Enchanting Feature (2 pt. Merit)
Blessed with magnificent eyes, sleek hair, mighty biceps,
preternatural grace, ripped abs, a dazzling smile, or some other
standout physical feature, you can enchant people with the raw
perfection of that feature. The feature in question doesn’t need
to be visually obvious, either; maybe you smell good, possess
a seductive voice, move with animalistic allure, or enjoy some
likewise wondrous physical asset. (Please be tasteful here, folks.)
This Merit takes the place of related Physical Merits such
as Enchanting Gaze, Soothing Voice, Graceful, and other
potentially similar attributes. Story-wise, this Enchanting Feature becomes a standout part of your character’s description.
System-wise, you reduce the difficulty by -2 when your character
deploys the feature in question as part of some social feat.
If your mage employs his Enchanting Feature Merit as part
of his magickal focus (see the Instruments entries for Eye Contact, Dance and Movement, Ordeals and Exertions, Sex and
Sensuality, Social Domination, and Voice and Vocalizations
in Mage 20, Chapter Ten), then you could count this Merit as
a personalized unique /specialized instrument (as detailed in
Mage 20, pp. 503 and 588). On the plus side, this allows you
to reduce certain casting difficulties by -2 when the feature in
question is specifically employed in the casting of an Effect. On
the not-so-good side, this might get your mage’s eyes gouged
out, his face marred, his vocal cords cut, or… well, you get the
picture… if a particularly ruthless enemy considers that feature
to be “the focus of his power.”
Physically Impressive (2 pt. Merit)
You are one imposing sumbitch, not so much large as
apparently dangerous no matter what mood you might be in
at the time. This could be as obvious as scarring or an intimidating build, or as intangible as the proverbial “air of menace.”
System-wise, the Merit adds two dice to all Social-Trait rolls
that involve intimidating someone; story-wise, people find
you unnerving – and quite possibly attractive in a dangerous
way – even when you’re not trying to be impressive.
Poison Resistance (2 pt. Merit)
Toxins may sicken you, but probably won’t kill you. Although
magickal poisons may be the exception to this rule, your body
shakes off the worst effects of natural and synthesized poisons.
When attacked by such substances, add two dice to your
character’s Stamina roll when resisting their effects; a successful
roll reduces the intensity of powerful toxins, and eliminates
the deadlier effects of lesser ones altogether. Sure, she might
feel a little woozy and could get seriously ill, but even if you
fail that roll your character probably won’t die.38 The Book of Secrets
Although it works against toxic bacteria, this Merit does not
protect against diseases spread from viruses, genetic conditions,
and so forth. For details, see Drugs, Poisons, and Disease in
Mage 20, pp. 441-444 and 456. And because intoxicants are
toxins too, this Merit helps you survive overdoses of booze or
drugs – see Alcohol /Drug Tolerance, above.
Poker Face (2 pt. Merit)
Nothing rattles you. Nothing. The emergence of a
titanic elder thing from the depths of space might warrant
a concerned twitch of your mouth, but that’s really about
it. Oh, this doesn’t mean you don’t feel anything – that’s
the Mental Flaw: Icy, below. Your deadpan expression,
blank eyes, and flat tone of voice, however, reveal nothing
about your thoughts or intentions… which, for folks on the
receiving end of you, can be quite disconcerting; reduce the
difficulty of intimidation, subterfuge, and resistance-to-intimidation rolls by -2, while adding +2 to the difficulties of
anyone who tries to rattle your cage or get under your skin,
including attempts to read, seduce, torture, or otherwise
get past that poker face.
Daredevil (3 pt. Merit)
You laugh at danger. Even when daring the Fates with
near-suicidal impulsiveness, you possess an innate knack for
not getting yourself perished. Add three dice to non-combat
and non-magickal rolls that involve some physical act of incomprehensible stupidity (leaping from roof to roof, diving into
a waterfall, jumping a motorcycle onto the back of a moving
train, etc.) that would turn the average mortal into hash.
Hypersensitivity (3 pt. Merit)
Extraordinarily open to physical sensations, you possess
a depth of sensitivity most folks cannot conceive of having.
A mere sip of wine can reveal its vintage to you; a whiff of
smoke betrays the quality (or lack thereof) and origins of its
burnt tobacco; a faint touch can conjure up orgasmic ecstasies.
Story-wise, you can easily “fall into” an enjoyable sensation, relishing it to a degree far beyond typical human
sensitivity. System-wise, you reduce the difficulty by -2 if you’re
trying to use a Perception + Alertness roll to identify details
about a sensation. Assuming that you employ instruments like
Bodywork, Drugs, Energy, Eye Contact, Food and Drink,
or Sex and Sensuality (and you probably use most or all of
them), you can get more “bang for your buck” from such sensations, which allows you to employ those instruments faster,
and perhaps (Storyteller’s option) gives you a -2 reduction to
the difficulty of associated Ability rolls. The normal modifier
limits still apply.
On the flipside, however, painful sensations and overstimulation can trigger paralyzing agonies and intense panic.
Whenever you experience a painful sensation without your
consent (that is, being flogged against your will, subjected
to loud music that you didn’t wish to hear, or injured by
something you didn’t want to be hurt by), you must make a
Willpower roll to avoid being “dragged under” and stunned
by the pain for a turn or two. (See Stunning in Mage 20, p.
417.) That roll’s difficulty depends upon the intensity of the
pain – from difficulty 4 for a minor annoyance, to difficulty
10 for screaming agony. As any Cultist can tell you, ecstasy is
indeed a two-way street!
Although this Merit goes well with Acute Senses, it cannot
be taken by a character who’s also Insensate to Pain (detailed
below).
Nightsight (3 pt. Merit)
Unlike most people, you can see in near-total darkness.
Only the complete absence of visible light will negate this
ability. In even the dimmest light, your visual abilities remain
essentially unimpaired.
This Merit does not increase your character’s visual capacity – for that gift, see Acute Senses, above; it does, however,
mean that low light does not impose any sort of penalty on
her visual perception rolls. Other visual impediments, like
smoke or fog, block her sight as usual, and magickally-imposed
darkness (for instance, the sort caused by deflecting light with
the Forces Sphere) negates this Merit if and when it involves
the dispersal of light itself.
Huge Size (4 pt. Merit)
You’re far bigger than usual – possibly over seven feet
tall and /or over 400 pounds in weight. Such large people
stand out in a crowd, and have a hard time literally “fitting
in” to a world built for smaller human beings. Still, your
character’s large build gives him one additional health level,
which counts as an extra level of Bruised when it comes to
wound-based penalties. If he shapeshifts into a smaller form
through Life-based magick, that extra health level goes away.
In his normal form, however, this large character can be quite
imposing and hard to beat.
Insensate to Pain (5 pt. Merit)
Nothing hurts until it kills you. Okay, it probably does hurt,
but not enough to slow you down. Wound penalties do not
affect your character at all; until she dies, she usually functions
with her full dice pools intact. This Merit does not in any way
change the way in which she takes damage – for that Merit, see
below – but it radically changes the way said damage affects
her ability to get things done.
There is, of course, a downside to all this: Pain tells us
that we’re not functioning properly and should probably
stop while we’re ahead. And so, you’ll also do stuff like
burn yourself by accident, try to walk on broken legs, and
notice cuts only when the blood is seeping through your
shirt. Although pain won’t slow you down, shattered bones
and organs will. Injuries that inflict significant physical impairment (crushed legs, broken skull, gouged-out eyes, etc.)
supersede your usual immunity to dice-pool penalties dueChapter One: Heroic Traits 39
to wounds, and you might inflict further lethal injury upon
yourself (Storyteller’s option) if you keep going after your
body tries to tell you to stop.
Too Tough to Die (5 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 644.
Physical Flaws
As any Life-skilled mage understands, “average” is a meaningless concept with regards to biological organisms. Even so,
certain features of a physical body make it harder for a person
to function in a world that’s often built for “average” people.
Physical Flaws reflect limitations of a character’s body that are
not – without magick, technology or both – things she can repair.
That said, a person with such “flaws” is often more resourceful
than someone who hasn’t had to work around those obstacles.
Physical Flaws also make excellent Genetic Flaws for
Enhanced and genegineered characters, as described in Mage
20, p. 650. Taken that way, however, each Flaw is worth only
one point, and so you’d be better off taking most such Flaws
in addition to the Genetic ones unless the Flaw in question is
worth only one or two points to begin with.
Addiction (1 or 3 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, p. 646.
Child (1 to 3 pt. Flaw)
Awakening often hits before legal maturity. This wasn’t a
problem in the old days, but within modern society a young mage
has certain built-in limitations: physical size, life experience,
legal status (or lack thereof), and the challenges of being taken
seriously in a grown-up world. Perhaps you’re a child prodigy…
or an adolescent whose reality truly is beyond understanding.
In any case, this Flaw represents the social, legal, and physical
obstacles of being a kid.
Depending on the value of this Flaw, your character might
be a young child (3 points), a pre-adolescent young person (2
points), or someone near the verge of adulthood but not quite
there (1 point). In the first two cases, you should also take Short
to reflect a growing body… and in all cases, your ability to run
with the mages is going to be limited by your age and the ways
in which people react to it. For more details, see Child-Mages
in Chapter Two, pp. 115-116.
Impediment (1 to 6 pt. Flaw)
Due to some physical condition, you’re less able to deal
with certain situations than most other people seem to be
able to do. And if all of that sounds very conditional, that’s
because the specifics of this Flaw depend a lot on the following
circumstances:
• What sort of condition you have.
• How much it gets in your way.
• Whether or not other people can tell that it gets in
your way.
Literally speaking, an impediment interferes with your path
by “blocking your feet.” System-wise, this Flaw reflects any sort
of impairment that’s based in your character’s physical situation.
That includes neurological and internal chemical conditions
like autism, dyslexia, chronic fatigue, significant allergies, and
other maladies that may be “invisible” to others but which are
rooted in the physical body, as opposed to in the psyche or the
spirit. Such conditions might be linked to psychological and
/or spiritual health too; those elements are interrelated, of
course. For the purposes of this Flaw, however, an Impediment
is something that hampers the character’s ability to function
in the physical realm.
Story-wise, an Impediment can be any body-based condition – obvious or not – that interferes with your character’s
ability to do stuff. Examples of obvious Impediments include a
missing limb, a limp, a bent spine, missing teeth, heavy scarring,
deformed features, and the like, while “invisible” Impediments
would include chronic pain and /or fatigue, poor eyesight,
asthma, internal tumors, sensory processing disorders, and so
forth. The more that condition impedes your character, the
more this Flaw is worth:
• (1point) Like chronic headaches, impaired vision, minor
arthritis or a few missing teeth, the Impediment presents
occasional inconveniences but is not a major hassle in
your life unless something worsens the condition or
removes the things (glasses, dentures, pain reliever) that
you use to compensate for it.
• (2 points) As with dyslexia, high-functioning Asperger’s
syndrome, chronic fatigue or pain, poor or deteriorating
eyesight, or other internal obstacles, your Impediment
presents constant but not insurmountable problems.
In certain situations, you may suffer a +1 to difficulties
that deal with that element of your life.
• (3 points) Your Impediment – severe migraines, significant autism, allergies or asthma, missing fingers or an
eye, near-deafness, palsy, Tourette’s syndrome, deteriorating limb(s), and so forth – significantly impairs several
elements of your everyday life. System-wise, you add +1
to difficulties related to your Impediment.
• (4 points) An inescapable Impediment – missing limb,
profound deafness or autism, near-blindness, malformed
bones or connective tissues (as with EDS, mentioned
above), severe arthritis, gnarled hands or feet, and similar obstacles – forces you to try working around that
condition on a daily basis. Under most circumstances,
you add +2 to difficulties related to that Impediment,
and certain situations (like a nasty allergic reaction)
might damage your health and endanger your life.40 The Book of Secrets
• (5 points) Thanks to a profound physical condition –
partial paralysis, constant and severe pain, advanced
cancer, the inability to hear or speak, muscular-skeletal
deterioration, major sight-loss, and other maladies –
you’re unable to function in most ways that people take
for granted. Add +2 to physical difficulties unless you’ve
got a reliable way to compensate for that handicap, and
assume that you simply cannot do certain things at all.
• (6 points) For whatever reasons, your condition is so advanced and severe that you need major work-arounds in
order to function in the everyday world. Many physical feats
are beyond you, and you add +2 or even +3 to difficulties
of things you can do but only with a major effort.
The Flaw reflects practical impairment in the character’s life;
if your mage has a cybernetic arm that acts like his original arm
only better, then that character is not impaired until or unless that
arm breaks down. If someone cures this condition with magick
or some other treatment, then the character loses this Flaw.
All forms of Impediment are not created equal, and so one
“blind” person can function in the seeing world better (that is, with
fewer points in the Flaw) than another visually-impaired person
(with more points in the Flaw) can do. The Impediment’s value
may also reflect several different conditions that, taken together,
impede that character’s ability to function “normally” more than
any single condition does. As an example, this author has dyslexia,
dyscalculia, poor vision, and two chronically injured knees; does
this stop him? No. Does it slow him down in certain respects? It
sure does, and so the total of his “Flaw” would reflect the amount
of difficulty that these conditions, all told, present in daily life.
This Flaw serves as a catch-all for previously published
Physical Flaws like Blind, Deaf, and especially the pejorative
Lame. Unlike many of the labels applied to such “handicaps,”
the Impediment Flaw does not carry any form of judgment on the
part of the game itself; although characters (and players) might
think less of a “lazy” person with five points in Impediment due
to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, the Flaw itself is not intended
in any way to be an insult against people with such conditions.
On that note, an unobvious Impediment may present
significant social challenges; a person with Tourette’s Syndrome
may seem perfectly healthy even as her brain misfires, with the
only visible symptoms being “inappropriate” sounds or actions.
(See the Mental Flaw:Inappropriate,p. 46) That mage with CFS
could be considered “too lazy to get out of bed” by people who
don’t see her body sabotaging her from the inside out. And so,
the value of the Flaw – with the Storyteller’s approval – might
reflect a penalty to social-based rolls instead of physical ones in
certain situations. (“Why weren’t you at work again?” “I couldn’t
take ten steps without falling over.” “Yeah, right…”)
Aging (2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 pt. Flaw)
You ain’t as young as you used to be… or perhaps you’re a little
tooyoung. The years have taken their toll on your physical capacities,
and while the spirit may be willing, the body most certainly is not.
System-wise, this Flaw reflects the diminished capabilities
of a body that is either too old or too young to employ its full
adult potential. For every two points in this Flaw, the character
loses one dot from a Physical Attribute (Strength, Dexterity or
Stamina), either because his body is aging past its prime, or
because it has not yet developed to mature capacity.
In the latter case, a young child (see the Flaw: Child,
above) should also take 4 points in this Flaw, with an older
child taking 2 points. Adolescent characters, obviously, have
no such physical limitations due to age, although they could
have other sorts of health issues, as described above under the
Flaw: Impediment.
Previous editions of this Flaw – that is, ones that were
written by authors in their 20s or early 30s – maintained that
a character must lose one dot of Physical Attributes for each
decade over 40. As this author (currently in his 50s, and in
better shape than he was at half this age) can attest, that’s
nonsense. A person can maintain, or even exceed, a young
adult’s physical capabilities well into middle age, and mages
– who employ Life magicks, yoga, and other forms of physical
conditioning – often age even better than most people do.
Considering that a skilled mage can live for centuries with little
(or no) loss of her physical abilities, this Flaw is not bound to
a character’s chronological age, only to her physical health in
relation to that age. Even so, ancient mages can get pretty frail.
For health problems related to greater stages of decrepitude,
see Impediment, above.
Easily Intoxicated (2 pt. Flaw)
Shit really fucks you up fast. The flipside of Alcohol /Drug
Tolerance, above, this Flaw renders you especially susceptible
to intoxication. Your Stamina rolls to resist the effects of drugs
or poisons (though not disease), as described in the Drugs,
Poisons, and Disease section of Mage 20, suffer a +3 modifier
to the usual difficulty involved. Contrary to popular conception,
this does not make you a good candidate for the Cult of Ecstasy
because you don’t control the drugs – the drugs control you.
Repulsive Feature (2 pt. Flaw)
Some physical feature of yours turns people away. Maybe
you smell bad regardless of your state of hygiene, possess the
proverbial “evil eye,” have an especially grating voice, suffer
from a pervasive skin condition, or have a similarly repugnant
physical characteristic. Perhaps the mere presence of you makes
people’s skins crawl even though there’s nothing discernibly
ugly about you. In any case, this feature discourages folks from
sticking around much.
Essentially the inverse of the Merit: Enchanting Feature,
this Flaw represents a concealable yet disconcerting element of
your physical presence. UnlikeImpediment, this Feature affects
the way people regard you, not the way your body functions. That
said, you could take both Flaws together, in order to reflect a
physically debilitating condition that has socially awkward effects
as well. The feature in question doesn’t represent overall ugliness,Chapter One: Heroic Traits 41
as per Monstrous and Horrific, below; instead, it manifests as
a single unpleasant physical distinction.
System-wise, this Flaw adds a +2 difficulty modifier to
Social-Trait rolls whenever this feature comes into play. Story-wise, this Flaw renders you physically distinctive unless you
make an effort to hide the Repulsive Feature. If you change
shape, that feature carries over into your other forms, which
interferes with disguise attempts. If the feature transcends visual
senses (like, for example, an unpleasant odor or grating voice),
it might betray your presence even if you can’t be seen. In both
cases, this Flaw penalizes your rolls for physical concealment
the same way it penalizes your social interactions.
As some consolation, the feature could be used to deliberately frighten or irritate people; in that case, the usual penalty
becomes a -2 to your difficulty instead. A Repulsive Feature that
has been integrated into your magickal focus (again, for instance,
the “evil eye”) offers the same instrumental benefits described
underEnchanting Feature, with the same potential for mutilation
and a greater incentive for someone to mess you up!
Profiled Appearance (2 pt. Flaw)
You look like one of those people… y’know, the people
that “respectable citizens” expect bad things from. Depending
on the setting of your chronicle, this could involve physical
mannerisms, body art, gender distinctions, individual features,
ethnic heritage, cybernetic modifications, or other elements
of your physical body that you cannot remove and probably
don’t want to “fix” anyhow. Problem is, the people around
you are constantly watching your every move, making trouble
for you when they can get away with it, and otherwise causing
you grief. The authorities shake you down on principle, and
most folks won’t object to whatever they choose to do to you.
Although it’s related to the Social Flaw: Cultural Other
(below), Profiled Appearance is based on your character’s
physical features, not on their social behavior. Although it can
be concealed to some degree, your Profiled Appearance is not
something that can be removed without magick, and it reflects
an essential part of your identity. Like Impediment, it does not
carry a value judgment in the game even though it represents the
way other characters will view you. If this feels unfair in the
game, imagine how it must feel in real life.
Degeneration (3, 6 or 9 pt. Flaw)
Your body is falling apart. A curse, disease, flawed biotech,
corrupting magicks, or some other affliction is rotting your
physical form, and although Life magick can repair the damage
to some degree, this degeneration remains permanent unless
the Flaw is somehow removed.
In its three-point variation, this Flaw reflects an inability to
heal injuries without the aid of magick or medical technology.
Until treated by Life Sphere Effects or medical intervention,
the character cannot recover heath levels lost to injury, disease
or other factors.
At the six-point level, the character suffers a constant
stream of injuries even without outside trauma. Whenever he’s
at full Health, that character loses one health level every two
weeks until he is either healed or he dies. As described above,
he cannot heal on his own.
At the nine-point level, that Health loss is essentially aggravated damage, and cannot be healed except through vulgar
Life-Sphere Effects.
Obviously, this Flaw is meaningless in one-shots or
short-duration games. It should be taken only by characters
(and players) involved in long-term chronicles.
Monstrous (3 pt. Flaw)
A frightening appearance marks you as an outsider. Regardless of your true personality and temperament, some profound
deformities, scars, body mods or other characteristics fill people
with terror and revulsion. System-wise, your character has an
Appearance of 0, and probably suffers penalties to social-based
rolls to win people over, while getting difficulty reductions
when trying to scare people, depending upon what he looks
like and who he’s dealing with.
Permanent Wound (3 pt. Flaw)
Due to lasting injury, Pattern leakage, a Paradox Flaw,
or some other physiological deficit, you suffer from a chronic
injury that never heals. This might be an incurable tumor,
endless bleeding, debilitating pain, brittle bones… the specifics are not important. Regardless of the cause, your character
is always at the Wounded health level; even with magickal
healing, the injury returns to its normal state at either sunrise
or sunset (your choice) every day. Although this wound does
not deteriorate further unless your character gets injured by
some other source – at which point, another four health levels
in damage can kill your character – this Permanent Wound
does not recover to a healthy state until and unless the Flaw is
bought off through a dramatic story-based cure.
Short (3 pt. Flaw)
Whether you’re the next Harry Potter or a budding Tyrion Lannister, you’re shorter than five feet tall… possibly a lot
shorter than that. In game terms, your character runs at half
the normal speed, has problems reaching certain things, lacks
the physical leverage for certain feats, and probably gets a lot
of shit from people who refuse to take him seriously.
Horrific (5 pt. Flaw)
Well pastMonstrous, you’re hideous to the point of inspiring
nightmares. Unless you mask your true form with serious magick,
people and animals run screaming from your presence. Physically,
you’re not merely misshapen but repulsive on a primal level – the
sort of terror that sent Lovecraft’s heroes over the edge. You might
not actually be a Nephandus or Marauder, but folks who know
what those words mean will assume that you are one. A normal
life is, for you, impossible. Whether due to Paradox disfigurement,42 The Book of Secrets
malignant disease, extreme body modifications (cybernetic, artistic,
or otherwise), severe scarring, or similar acts of malevolent fate,
you look like John Cobb threw up on you, then ran.
System-wise, this Flaw inflicts a +3 difficulty modifier to any
social roll that involvesnotscaring the shit out of people, and lowers
the difficulty by -3 if you are. Your Appearance Trait is stuck below
zero, and faint-hearted or weak-willed Storyteller characters may be
faced with Things Man Was Not Meant to Know (as per Mage
20, p. 407) if they wind up spending time with you.
Mayfly Curse (5 or 10 pt. Flaw)
Your lifespan burns bright and fast. Due, perhaps, to
biotech, cloning, or some other inhuman heritage or modification, you age far more quickly than normal human beings
do. While this means that you reach(ed) maturity in record
time, it ushers in premature decrepitude. When you live this
fast, kid, one way or another, you’re dying young!
At the five-point level of this Flaw, your character ages one
year for every two months of earthly time (six years of age for
each passing year). At the 10-point level, he ages one year per
week (or 52 years of age in a single 12-month period). Such a
character had best watch out for Time-savvy mages; the Accelerated Youth or Decay feat described in How Do You DO That?
( pp. 111-112) has horrific effects on a mayfly, who suffers six
to 52 years of aging for each year of time inflicted upon him.
As the years rush in, other Flaws like Aging, Impediment,
Absent-Minded, and so forth may pile up on this character as
well. Life-Sphere magick cannot negate this Flaw, which could be
interpreted as a manifestation of the Unbelief form of Paradox,
unless the player buys off the Flaw… and perhaps not even then.
Mental Merits
Mages depend upon their mental faculties. Although vampires, werefolk, and the like prize certain mental aptitudes, most
Neurodiversity and Mental Traits
Minds aren’t machines. For all the talk of “normal brains” and “average functionality,” medical research and social
activism have shown that such ideas are absurd. In older days, people slapped labels on folks whose mental capabilities
seemed to be “different”: slow, moron, diminished capacity, retarded. (Also, brilliant, genius, egghead, and savant.)
Some people cling to those definitions even now. In the twenty-first century, however, two terms have gained preference
over those old labels: neurodivergence and neurodiversity.
Essentially,neurodivergencemeans “someone whose brain-functions diverge from the human norm,” while neurodiversity
means “all of our brains work differently, so let’s respect our differences.” Some folks argue that the latter term is too
broad-ranging and “politically correct” to be useful, while others assert that neurodivergent is an insult which holds
human minds to an unrealistic standard. Both arguments have merit; severe mental conditions do interfere with a
person’s ability to function in the everyday world, and it is insulting to call folks “divergent” when their minds work
along different lines than other people’s minds do. (Maybe less insulting than moron, but you get the idea.) As of this
writing, neurodiversity is the preferred term among people who want to be inclusive, not divisive, with regards to the
vast range of human minds.
What does this have to do with Mage? For starters, both Merits and Flaws in the Mental category reflect “divergence”
from supposedly normal mental functions. If these traits didn’t diverge from the norm, they would not be “merits” or
“flaws.” Secondly, both the benefits and the drawbacks originate with the same source: mental capacity that ranges
beyond the apparent human norm. People whose minds work differently than other people’s minds work have pluses
in some regards and minuses in others. And so, a character who has, say, Lightning Calculator might also behave
in ways that are Inappropriate to many situations. This works the opposite way too – witness the ways in which
autistic people often Hyperfocus with uncanny acuity. Mental conditions, pro and con, tend to be intertwined. The
conditions that nurture the Merit often nurture the Flaw as well, and so characters with Mental Merits or Flaws really
ought to have both.
Because neurological conditions like dyslexia and the autistic spectrum have physical causes which affect mental
processing, such conditions are considered, in game terms, to be Impediments, as in the Physical Flaw of that name.
(See pp. 39-40.) The ways in which they manifest, though, can come through as Mental Merits and /or Flaws too.
Other, more nebulous conditions, like Chronic Depression, may have physical sources with predominantly mental
results for one character, and completely psychological sources for another. Such distinctions, of course, fall into the
rather Technocratic mind /body Cartesian duality thing, which doesn’t really suit the spirit of Mage. To be honest, all
these distinctions are arbitrary anyhow. Minds aren’t lists of game traits, either. It really doesn’t matter whether a given
Merit or Flaw is Physical, Mental, Social, or even Supernatural – only that it guides roleplaying and affects gameplay.
Technically, all mages are neurodivergent. Awakened consciousness is functionally different than a Sleeping mind,
and can perform tasks (like, say, magick) that a “normal” mind cannot manage. Even so, mental Merits and Flaws
represent significant departures from what the “average” mage can do, and so a character who has such Traits is
functioning on a different mental plane – for better and worse – than the characters who do not. When choosing such
Traits, and roleplaying them out, we recommend keeping that fact literally in mind.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 43
Awakened characters favor those abilities over all else. And so,
it’s likely that your mage will have at least one Mental Merit…
and, all things being related, may well suffer from Mental Flaws
as well, as described in the sidebar nearby.
Like Physical Flaws, Mental Flaws make excellent Genetic
Flaws for Enhanced and biomodded characters, especially for
ones whose “modifications” and /or origins remain essentially
invisible to the naked eye. Constructs (Technocratic and otherwise) are especially subject to such conditions. See the heading
Physical Flaws for details.
Artistically Gifted (1 pt. Merit)
The Muses work their will through you, or so it appears.
Whenever you employ your artistic talent (as in, the Talent: Art
in Mage 20, p. 275), reduce the difficulty of those rolls by -2. As
with other Merits of this kind,this Merit does not reduce the difficulty
of magick-casting rolls, but may reduce the difficulty of Attribute
+ Ability rolls that are involved with magickal acts. (For more
details, see Abilities Enhancing Magick, Mage 20, pp. 533.)
Common Sense (1 pt. Merit)
If such sense were truly common, there wouldn’t be a
Merit to represent it. Still, you have a gift for thinking one
step ahead and assessing the potential consequences of your
choices. Essentially, this Merit gives you a Get Out of Doing
Something Stupid Free card; whenever you announce an action that wouldn’t be especially bright (for example, throwing
a Time-Sphere spell at Old Man Wrinkle), the Storyteller may
ask, “Are you sure you wanna do that?” Thus warned, you’re free
to ignore the advice of your smarter angels. Still, you do get a
momentary insight into potential dumbassery, which is more
than most people get. Use it wisely.
Computer Aptitude (1 pt. Merit)
A true child of the twenty-first century, you’re especially
adept with computerized infotech. Reduce all difficulties
involving computer-based rolls by -2, up to the usual modifier
limit. This last caveat is especially important when dealing with
computer-based magickal Effects, whose difficulties cannot be
reduced by this Merit beyond the usual magick-roll modifier of -3,
or below the minimum difficulty for magick-casting rolls. Even
so, this Merit provides an edge for mages whose Arts include
the guiding technology of our age.
For detailed optional rules regarding computer usage, see
Computer Systems in Chapter Two, pp. 116-127.
Concentration (1 pt. Merit)
Even by mage standards, you’re especially good at tuning
out distractions. When you’re attempting some sort of feat that
demands focus (as most do), this Merit eliminates modifiers44 The Book of Secrets
that would be caused by distracting circumstances – gunfire,
thunderstorms, rampaging critters from beyond the stars, and
so forth. Truly distracting situations (trying to hack a computer
system during a tornado, for instance) might demand a successful Willpower roll in order to wipe out the potential penalty;
the difficulty would depend upon the circumstances. For the
most part, though, you get in and get stuff done, whatever else
might be going on around you.
Expert Driver (1 pt. Merit)
You were born to drive like a demon wherever the road
takes you. All of your driving-roll difficulties are reduced by -2.
Language (1 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 643.
Lightning Calculator (1 pt. Merit)
Your head is a calculator of impressive capability. With
a few moments of thought, you can perform intricate mathematical feats – a useful talent for Hermetic wizards, Syndicate
operatives, Enlightened engineers, and other mages who employ
math and geometry in their work.
System-wise, this Merit allows you to reduce the difficulties
of math- and calculation-based rolls by -2. Simple calculations
take no time at all, while sophisticated problems may demand
a turn or more. Obviously, your character needs access to the
proper data before she can work out calculations… and garbage
in, garbage out, so make sure your data is accurate!
For potential applications of math in magick, see the
instrument entries for Circles and Geometric Designs,
Formulae and Math, Money and Wealth, and Numbers
and Numerology in Mage 20, pp. 590-596, as well as the
practices of Hypereconomics (pg. 573), High Ritual Magick
and Hypertech (pp. 578-579), and Reality Hacking (pp. 581-
582). Remember that Merits cannot reduce the difficulty of
a magick-casting roll below the minimum difficulty, or by
more than -3. That said, fast and accurate calculations make
useful aids when you’re using Mundane Skills and Magickal
Effects, as described in the entry of that name (Mage 20, pp.
532-534). Depending upon the feat in question, this could
employ a roll of Intelligence + Academics to work out most
calculations, Perception + Academics to discern odds or
geometrical dimensions, and Wits + Academics to belt out
rapid guesstimates with only the roughest of data.
Mechanical Aptitude (1 pt. Merit)
Oh, you technophile, you! Blessed by the machine gods,
you’ve got a knack for mechanical gear. As with most Merits of
this type, such aptitude allows you to reduce difficulties by -2
when you’re making rolls based around working with mechanical technology. No, you don’t have to be a technomancer to
use such a gift, much less a member of the Technocracy; still,
this aptitude does suggest that mechanical technology means
a great deal to you, which – by extension – suggests that your
paradigm, practice, and instruments have something to do with
applications of mechanical principles and tech. For suggestions,
see the paradigms A Mechanistic Cosmos, Everything is Data,
and Tech Holds All the Answers in Mage 20, pp. 568-571, as
well as the related practices and instruments and the related
material in this book’s Chapter Three. For more practical
applications of this Merit, meanwhile, see Mage 20’s section
regarding The Technological World, pp. 458-464.
Time Sense (1 pt. Merit)
You’ve got an intuitive sense of what time it is in your
vicinity. Much like the Rank 1 Time Effect, but without the
ability to spot ripples in the time stream, this Merit provides
a sort of internal clock that helps you gauge the time of day
and the passing of time even when you don’t have access to
windows, clocks, or other information about time.
This Merit does not grant bonuses or decrease difficulties
for Time Sphere-based magick-casting rolls. It does, however,
give one of the benefits of basic Time Sphere perceptions to
characters who do not employ the Time Sphere.
Code of Honor (2 pt. Merit)
Guided by a strong sense of ethics, you follow a particular
standard of conduct. This might be a military honor-code,
a religious creed, the law of a given fellowship to which you
belong, or possibly your personal moral center. Regardless
of its origins, this code guides your decisions, informs your
activities, and sometimes forces you to make hard choices that
less-ethical people never face.
Thanks to that code, your character gains two additional
dice to all Willpower rolls when he acts in accordance with his
code of honor, or when he resists some temptation or compulsion that might get him to betray that code. Obviously, you and
your Storyteller should work out the specific tenets of this code
during the character-creation process. If you do not honor that
code, then you’ll probably lose the Merit… and suffer disgrace,
as well, among other parties who know and respect your vows.
Eidetic Memory (2 pt. Merit)
Gifted with the proverbial photographic memory, you
clearly recall details about something you read, view, or otherwise experience. A serious boon for ritual magicians, field ops,
and tech-minded magi, this Merit lets your character remember
stuff even if you, the player, do not.
Under most circumstances, your character easily recalls
the memories in question. Really detailed memories, or ones
gathered under stressful conditions, might require a Perception
+ Alertness roll before the character can remember essential
elements of the moment she’s trying to recall.
Memory, of course, is subjective, and so while this Merit
allows you remember things as you perceive them, those memories
will still be based upon your perspective – internal as well as
external – which is not the same as having access to some objective god-view of that experience! Especially in a game aboutChapter One: Heroic Traits 45
subjective reality, that’s an important distinction – one that
also keeps this Merit from becoming a potential game-breaker.
Folks with such memories are often subject to PTSD, as in
the Flaw of that name. That’s especially true when people face
Things Man Was Not Meant to Know, as described in Mage
20, p. 407. Vivid recall has its drawbacks, and in the traumatic
world of a mage, some things really are best forgotten!
Inner Strength (2 pt. Merit)
Faced with adversity, you prevail. System-wise, this Merit
reduces the difficulty of Willpower rolls by -2 when you struggle
against apparently overwhelming odds.
Natural Linguist (2 pt. Merit)
You’re especially good at understanding how people communicate. Every purchase of the Language Merit (see above,
and Mage 20, Appendix II) secures two languages for you,
not just one. You also get three bonus dice when making rolls
based upon clear communications, typically ones employing
Art, Expression, Etiquette, Leadership, and other Traits that
involve “speaking their language” to impress someone else.
This Merit does not add three dice to magickal casting rolls
when using language as an instrument. It may, however, apply the
bonus to a mundane roll that could enhance a magick- casting
attempt – see Abilities Enhancing Magick, Mage 20, p. 533.
Hyperfocus (3 pt. Merit)
Given time and a lack of distractions, you can focus your
mind to an uncanny extent. For every hour spent focusing
without distractions on a mundane task (not on a magick-casting
roll), you may add one die to your dice pool for each roll made
during an extended action (as described in Mage 20, p. 389).
This bonus has a limit of three dice, total. So if, for example,
Nix has Hyperfocus and spends two hours on a task, zir player
adds two extra dice to Nix’s dice pool; three hours’ focus provide
three dice, but four hours of focus keeps those three dice. All
two or three dice, however, get used every time Nix’s player
makes a roll to complete that extended action.
As noted above, this Merit does not assist magickal casting rolls. Due to the time required to focus – and the lack of
distractions involved – Hyperfocus doesn’t help in combat
situations either, although a strategy-minded character could
hyperfocus on planning for a battle, but not on fighting it
once the combat began. On a similar note, a mage could use
Hyperfocus to aid in the mundane elements of a ritual – see
Rituals and Mundane Abilities, Mage 20, p. 541.
Extreme hyperfocus is often (though not exclusively) associated with people on the autistic spectrum, although some
authorities claim that perseveration (see the Flaw: Mental Lock)
is more a more accurate way of looking at that intense form of
focus. With or without autism, this Merit comes in handy for
Hermetics, technomancers, shamans, and other mages whose
practices depend upon extreme dedication to certain tasks.
Iron Will (3 pt. Merit)
Even by Awakened standards, you possess a formidable
will. When you make up your mind or dig in your heels
against mental influence, your determination’s hard to break.
System-wise, your character receives three extra dice for his
Willpower rolls whenever he faces a challenge to his convictions,
or resists attempts at Mind magick, torture, exhaustion, and
other debilitating attacks. If the character ever crosses paths
with a vampire or other mind-controlling entity, he can shake
off the effects of such assaults by spending a single Willpower
point. See also the Resisting feat on the Dramatic Feats chart,
Mage 20, p. 403.
Jack-of-All-Trades (3 pt. Merit)
You know a little about a lot. When attempting to make
a roll using a Skill (not a Talent) that your character does not
possess, you don’t suffer the usual penalty. (See Skills, Mage 20,
p. 279.) If you’re trying to use a Knowledge your character does
not possess, you can still make the roll but with an addition of
+2 to the normal difficulty. (See Knowledges, Mage 20, p. 283.)
Because Talent Traits represent innate gifts honed by
practice, this Merit does not grant access to Talents that your
character does not possess.
Scientific Mystic /Techgnosi (3 pt. Merit)
Certain unorthodox technomancers understand that
“mysticism” is just another form of science whose principles
may be understood by a properly Enlightened mind. Although
you pursue a technological practice and employ tech-based
instruments, you can employ instruments that are traditionally
considered to be “magic” once you’ve had an opportunity to
study them and fit those tools into your scientific paradigm.
TheScientific MysticMerit lets a dedicated technomancer
– that is, a member of the Society of Ether, the Virtual Adepts,
a tech-based “orphan,” or perhaps even a rogue Technocrat
like the Disparates of Navalon – study metaphysical principles from mystic-paradigm mages for no extra point-cost if
that technomancer has the focus practice Weird Science.
(For details, see Can a Mage Who Uses One Type of Focus
Learn Magick from a Mage Who Uses a Different Kind of
Focus?, Chapter Three, p. 174, and the Weird Science entry in
Mage 20, p. 584.) That technomancer can also choose traditionally “mystic” tools as up to half of her required instruments
(as detailed under Arete, Focus, and Instruments in Mage 20,
p. 329), and can discard those instruments as a mystic instead
of as a technomancer (again, see Mage 20, p. 329). Essentially,
this means that your approach to Enlightened science is flexible
enough to embrace bizarre approaches to your metaphysical
pursuits. Other scientists might consider such things impossible, but you realize that “possibility” is what you make of it.
On the other side of that metaphysical coin, the Techgnosi
Merit allows a dedicated mystic to do the exact same things,
but with technological instruments and no extra cost involved46 The Book of Secrets
in studying magick from technomancer peers, regardless of
your practices. (See the Chapter Three entry cited above.) Yes,
your soul belongs to the Mysteries, but you’ve recognized that
technology has a place in those Mysteries as well.
Berserker (4 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 644, and the Flaw: Stress Atavism.
Judge’s Wisdom (4 pt. Merit)
Through firm self-discipline, you have mastered your emotions
to Vulcan perfection. No passion-based assault can rattle your
judgment, and the base attacks of heart-twisting fiends have little
hold on you. Rules-wise, you remain immune to Mind- or Lifebased Effects that influence emotions (as detailed in How Do You
DO That?, pp. 60 and 120-122), and can shrug off the vampiric
Discipline of Presence unless that bloodsucker has at least six dots
in that Discipline. Emotion-based powers from werecreatures,
faeries, and other such creatures cannot affect you, although you
can still be possessed, mind-controlled, enchanted, and otherwise
bent or broken so long as the assault is not based on wrangling an
emotional response from your perfect serene command.
Self-Confident (5 pt. Merit)
Mages are confident; you’re even more so. When spending
Willpower to gain an automatic success, you don’t even need
to lose that point of Willpower unless:
1) The Willpower-gained success is the only success you
get for that action; or…
2) the difficulty for that action is 5 or less. This Merit
kicks in only in challenging circumstances, and tasks with a
difficulty of 5 or lower are just too easy to demand help from
your character’s self-confidence.
Mental Flaws
Mages tend – with good reason! – to be seen as crazy,
obsessive, or otherwise touched in the head. And so, mental
Flaws are common among those nutty Awakened types, most
especially the ones who, for reasons mentioned earlier in
the Neurodiversity and Mental Traits sidebar, have mental
Merits as well.
Compulsion (1 pt. Flaw)
An almost reflexive mental tic drives you toward compulsive, often subconscious, behaviors. In some cases, especially
among mages, these behaviors manifest as ritualized activities:
hand-washing, obsessive grooming, doing a task exactly the
same way every time, and so forth. Other compulsions inspire
annoying habits (humming, making farty noises with your
mouth, speaking out loud even when you don’t mean to, etc.),
or potentially harmful activities like shoplifting, gambling,
or hitting on everything that moves, which manifest when
you’re under stress. (A seriously harmful compulsion could be
considered a Derangement Flaw instead, as referenced below.)
Minor compulsions tend to get chalked up to the rationalization, “That’s just what she’s like.” If you want your
character to avoid a serious compulsion, however, you must
spend a Willpower point in order to put off that behavior for
a little while. However, once that little while is up (Storyteller’s
discretion), your character is again compelled to perform that
activity… unless you spend another Willpower point… to put
it off again for a little while longer…
Hero Worship (1 pt. Flaw)
You adore another character, to the point where that person
can do no wrong as far as you’re concerned. Attempts to sway
your opinion will just piss you off, shut you down, or drive
you to heights (or depths) of absurd justification for whatever
someone says about him. A common trait among folks in an
Echo Chamber (see the Social Flaw of that name, pp. 66-67),
this psychological blind spot can become annoying, even hazardous, if centered on the wrong person… like, say, a Syndicate
Manager, a Nephandus, or certain presidential candidates!
If your hero tells you to do something, you’re inclined to
obey, and must make a Willpower roll in order to refuse their
desires. The difficulty for this roll depends upon the extremity
of those desires; “Gimme a kiss,” would probably be difficulty 5,
while “Go stab your best friend in the back for me” would be 9 or 10.
If and when you’re confronted with proof of your hero’s weaknesses, you are capable of seeing reason eventually – it’s just not
easy to get you to think so clearly. Any social roll that’s aimed at
getting you to discard your hero worship adds +2 to its difficulty
unless the hero has recently done something very wrong… like,
say, telling you to stab your best friend in the back for him!
Impatient (1 pt. Flaw)
You’re driven to act now, not wait till later. In situations
where other folks seem to just take for-freakin’-ever to get something done, make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) to restrain
yourself from just running off to do it your own damn self! Yes,
that difficulty may go up if… maybe when… you have to wait
even longer than before. God, would the rest of the world would
just get moving already?
Inappropriate (1 to 4 pt. Flaw)
Wow – did you just go there? Yep, you did… and will go
there again soon enough. Thanks to some quirk of personality,
you tend to say and do things that other folks frown upon,
typically at the least appropriate times. You make cooked-cat
jokes in Asian restaurants, say what’s on your mind when it’s
best to keep your mouth shut, and stumble over courtesy like it
was a kiddie-gate you weren’t tall enough to avoid. This could
involve activities too, like picking your nose in front of an elder
or showing Martyrs to your 8-year-old niece. God damn it all,
what were you thinking?
Minds do weird shit, and so this Flaw reflects a mental
condition or psychological kink that drives the character toward
embarrassing behaviors. Contrary to popular belief, this does notChapter One: Heroic Traits 47
necessarily mean the character is Asperger’s /autistic, although
it could compliment the physical Flaw: Impediment if that
Flaw represents an autistic spectrum condition that manifests
in especially inappropriate behavior. (An autistic character does
not have to take this Flaw, as many folks on the spectrum do
not behave this way.) The quirk in question might come from
a strange upbringing, psychic trauma, past lives acting out
(“What? In MY day, this sort of thing was perfectly acceptable!”),
alien cultural mores, social isolation, Avatar dickery, or any
other mental stutter that screws with social-pattern recognition.
A physical condition, like autism or Tourette’s syndrome, is
more suited to the Impediment Flaw.
As with Impediment, the value of this Flaw depends upon
the degree to which it causes problems for your character:
• (1 point) You occasionally say and do silly shit that causes
small degrees of embarrassment to you and your friends.
+1 difficulty to social rolls if and when you act out.
• (2 points) Your quirk inspires some pretty mortifying
behavior on a fairly regular basis. +1 difficulty to many
social rolls, even when you’re not acting out at the
moment.
• (3 points) Dude, you need to STFD and STFU or
you’re going to be in big trouble… again. +2 difficulty
to all social rolls that aren’t related to making an ass of
yourself.
• (4 points) You are a source of constant headaches to
anyone who dares to identify as your friend. +2 difficulty
to social rolls, plus a bad reputation among folks who’ve
met or heard of you.
For obvious reasons, this Flaw could be a major-league
trigger for certain players, especially if the inappropriate behavior includes bigotry and /or sexual misbehavior. A player who
decides to take this Flaw should discuss it with her Storyteller
and fellow players… and if it becomes a source of real-life friction
around the table, the Flaw should be discarded, or else played
“offstage” rather than acted out in real time. (See Triggers,
Limits, and Boundaries in Mage 20, p. 345.) IT SHOULD
NEVER BE USED AS AN EXCUSE FOR REAL-LIFE DICKERY, EVER. (Was that clear enough?) This Flaw is intended
as a “mature audiences” option that reflects the unfortunate
effects of mental malfunctions and social maladjustments. If
a player cannot employ this Flaw in a mature manner, then it
should not be employed at all.
Mental Lock (1 pt. Flaw)
Somewhere in between impulse and action, things get stuck
inside your head. Thoughts or images wind up caught in mental
loops, and you occasionally find yourself tripping over words, getting
stuck in patterns of speech, or repeating apparently uncontrollable
activities (flapping your hands, shaking your head, rubbing your
wrists, and so forth) which, under most circumstances, would be
easy to stop or manage. Sometimes known asperseverationorstimming
(see the Merit:Hyperfocus), these mental tics often manifest from
brain damage, emotional trauma, intense stress, and /or autism
and other sensory-processing conditions. Conventionally and
incorrectly called “nervous habits,” these mental quirks may be
attempts to control your apparently chaotic surroundings by giving
your brain something that feels like you can control it. Problem is,
you essentially have to shake yourself out of the locked pattern,
concentrate on a new sensation in order to break the loop, invoke
a sort of “ritualized” word or action that triggers a break in that
loop, or employ some other method to break free of the mental
lock. Until that point, you could find yourself stuttering even
though you don’t have a speech impediment, feel “frozen” on
words or thoughts you can’t easily articulate, lock into near-obsessive
ruminations on nonsense phrases or perilous thoughts, get stuck
doing the same thing over and over again, or otherwise wind up
focused on an internal feedback cycle.
System-wise, the Storyteller will occasionally drop small but
annoying quirks into your character’s ability to speak, suggest
small, repetitious actions for your character to perform, and
otherwise screw with your character’s capacity to move beyond
a single nagging thought. To break those mental locks, you’ll
need to roll your character’s Willpower against difficulty 7,
spend a temporary point of Willpower, or else stand around
“locked up” in mid-thought or action until you can break that
irritating mental block through force of will or (after five turns)
the simple passage of time.
Nightmares (1 or 3 pt. Flaw)
Night, for you, is a long parade of imagined horrors. Almost every time you reach Dreamland, the inhabitants drag
you through hell until you finally manage to escape back to
the waking world. Your nightmares could come from psychic
trauma, abuse, brain damage, Quiet, Paradox, Social Processing,
encounters with Things Man Was Not Meant to Know, or
other things that mess with your head. Whatever their source,
these nocturnal hellrides affect your waking life as well.
Story-wise, these constant nightmares play havoc with your
character’s mood, sleep, and long-term sanity. (For examples,
see the Prelude for Mage 20.) At the three-point level, these
nightmares force the player to make a Willpower roll, difficulty
7, each time her character wakes up from sleep; a failed roll
subtracts one die from all of her dice pools that day. (Yes,
previously published versions of this Flaw inflict that penalty
on any character with the 1 pt. Nightmares Flaw. A full-die
penalty on all rolls for a day, however, seems out of proportion
with a one-point Flaw, and so this book introduces a three-point
variation on the Trait. Storytellers may decide to use the older
version of this Flaw for consistency’s sake.)
This Flaw makes an especially ugly companion to the
Background: Demesne (Mage 20, pp. 310-311). In this case,
the nightmares twist the Dream Realm into a perpetual horrorshow. Attempts to alter the dreamscape are at difficulty 7
(for the one-point Flaw) or 9 (for the three-point Flaw), and the48 The Book of Secrets
dreamscape will remain unpleasant, if bearably so, no matter
what the dreamer does to affect it. Those same difficulties apply
to a character who wants to change the dreams by using the
Talent: Lucid Dreaming (Mage 20, p. 294); change is possible,
then, but far from easy.
Overconfident (1 pt. Flaw)
You’re the best there is at what you do. If other folks disagree,
then that’s their problem, not yours! Nothing is beyond your
reach, and so you almost never back down from a challenge, no
matter how absurdly outmatched you appear to be at the time.
If things go poorly, of course, you can always blame someone
else. After all, it’s clearly not your fault!
Shy (1 pt. Flaw)
Interpersonal relations are not your forte. Commonly
known these days as social anxiety, this Flaw adds +2 to the
difficulty of your social rolls, thanks to your discomfort when
dealing with other folks. If, all the gods forbid, you wind up
as the center of attention (a situation you avoid whenever
possible), your social rolls gain a +3 addition to their difficulty.
Story-wise, this shyness comes across as avoidance, introversion,
and awkwardness in many social situations even when you
actually want to hang out and make a good impression.
Soft-Hearted (1 pt. Flaw)
You hate to witness suffering. Sadly, the World of Darkness
is filled with pain, and so you often find yourself either avoiding
potentially traumatic situations or trying to ease suffering even
when that puts you in the line of fire too.
When confronted with someone else’s physical or emotional pain, make a Willpower roll (difficulty 8). If you fail,
your character either withdraws from the situation or possibly
(if his beliefs /faith /paradigm /Nature demands action) does
something reckless in order to prevent further suffering. A
successful roll means that you can act normally… which could
still involve withdrawal or recklessness, but displaying a bit
more self-control.
Speech Impediment (1 pt. Flaw)
For psychological reasons (as opposed to a physical reason,
as per the Flaw: Impediment), you speak with some sort of
frustrating imperfection: a lisp, a stutter, a too-broad accent, a
whisper, and so forth. Clearly, this interferes with your attempts
to wax eloquent; System-wise, add +2 to the difficulty of rolls
that involve speaking clearly. This Flaw should be roleplayed
out whenever possible, and it carries over if your character
changes into some other form… after all, it’s your mind, not
your body, that’s causing the problem; if it is your body, then
take the Flaw: Impediment instead.
Vanilla (1 pt. Flaw)
Oh my gods, you’re such an innocent! In a world filled
with sex magick and power plays, you’re the little lamb who’s
strayed far away from home. Jokes get past you, clues escape
you, and references to anything rawer than a Disney flick go
straight over your head. Maybe you grew up in a secluded place
with overprotective parents; or you could be in denial about
the things you see all around you because life can’t possibly be
that twisted… can it? Regardless, hold firm to your innocence.
Once it’s gone, it ain’t never coming back again!
Whimsy (1 pt. Flaw)
You get silly under stress. It’s an avoidance tactic, and while
such behavior can be endearing in small doses, your whimsical
streak can get kinda annoying after a while, especially for folks
who have to deal with you pulling out hand puppets in the
middle of an argument or tossing grapes down your covenmate’s
cleavage when she’s trying to have a serious conversation with
you. In especially stressful situations, you might need to make
a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) to not clown around. Hey, you
can’t help it, right, if you’re trying to lighten the mood? Jeeze,
why does magick have to be so damned serious…?
Amnesia (2 pt. Flaw)
Life before Awakening remains a mystery to you. Friends?
Family? Mundane existence? Whoever and whatever they were,
you cannot recall. This amnesia might be related to PTSD,
fugue-state dissociative Derangement (Mage 20, pp. 648-649),
brain-trauma, Quiet, Social Processing (as shown in thePrelude
for Mage 20), psychic assault (see Uncanny Influence in How
Do You DO That?, pp. 114-136), Things Man Was Not Meant
to Know, or other forms of identity disruption. Regardless of
the reason, being a mage is all you can remember.
Beyond all of the obvious complications involved in
near-total amnesia (lack of memories, social disorientation, legal
nonexistence, a fractured sense of self, and so on), this Flaw also
allows you to take up to five points in “mystery Flaws.” Your
Storyteller will know what they are, but you won’t. Throughout
the chronicle, she’ll spring them on you in various entertaining
ways. Perhaps when all is revealed, you’ll be able to buy off this
Flaw (or have it “paid off” by the Storyteller, in lieu of experience points), and then remember who you were. Whether
or not you’ll like the answers, of course, remains to be seen…
Curiosity (2 pt. Flaw)
You simply can’t resist a good mystery! A nagging sense of
curiosity drags you into all kinds of sticky situations. Given your
abilities, you’ve got a decent chance at finding things out, too…
which is not, especially in the World of Darkness, an especially
healthy thing to do. Isn’t that just like a damn mage, anyway?
When confronted with an enticing clue or enigmatic circumstance, make a Wits roll to avoid giving in to temptation.
The difficulty for that roll depends upon the situation: a casual
mystery (like, say, the identity of that intriguing girl behind the
counter at Starbucks) would be difficulty 5, while resisting a
more compelling sort of mystery (like the identity of the person
who dropped off a dozen roses at your Chantry house) wouldChapter One: Heroic Traits 49
be difficulty 9. Once you’re on the trail, few things short of a
deadly threat will make you stop… and said deadly threat might
simply encourage you to dig even deeper.
Icy (2 pt. Flaw)
You are one ice-cold bastard – an assassin, gangbanger, sociopath, or sadist who can commit atrocities without the slightest
twitch. Although you’re not necessarily insane (see the Derangements in Mage 20, pp. 649-650), your callousness marks you as
a creepy motherfucker. People avoid you unless they’ve got killing
that needs doing… and then they step back and let you do your
thing. Room 101 has positions for people like you (and so, despite
their good-guy façade, do the Traditions and Disparate groups),
but no one truly trusts you, and your soul is definitely in peril,
with the Fallen only a step or two away from owning your cold ass.
Intemperate (2 pt. Flaw)
Everything you do, you do to excess. Oh, sure, you can
(usually) resist the urge to be terminally stupid, but moderation
isn’t part of your vocabulary. Having a drink? Why not have
six? A hand of cards? Why not bet your next paycheck on the
outcome? From expressing opinions to risking body and soul,
you play chicken with life and expect the other guy to swerve.
Folks expect this sort of thing from Ecstasy Cultists, but most
Ecstatics actually have a better sense of their limits than you do.
Whenever you happen to be doing something that probably
won’t result in criminal charges or immediate death, make a
Willpower roll to resist the urge to go whole-hog. The difficulty
for the roll depends on the likely consequences of excess; taking
little risks means difficulty 8 or 9, while risks with life-threatening
potential are easier to resist (difficulty 5 or 6)… though you’ve
been known to go too far in that department, too!
Obsession (2 pt. Flaw)
An all-consuming interest of yours tends to overshadow
whatever passes, in your mind, for common sense. If you love
Star Wars, then you’ve seen all the movies many times over, own
tons of merchandise, and spend inordinate amounts of time
arguing about SW trivia. Is Tarot your obsession? Then you’ve
got dozens (if not hundreds) of decks, research every potential
element of Tarot significance, and drive your friends crazy with
constant offers of readings and advice. You can’t have just one
or two cats – you’re the local Crazy Cat Person who drops half
a paycheck on food, litter, and veterinary bills. This obsession
probably won’t get you killed or anything (unless you’re crazy
enough to get obsessive about werecritters or similarly fatal
topics), but it consumes vast amounts of time, attention, and
cash. When faced with an opportunity to pursue your obsession
down unexplored avenues, or if that obsession interferes with
important things like relationships, work or both, you may50 The Book of Secrets
need to make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) to suppress the
urge. And if the obsession involves something that’s compulsive
by nature – gambling, for example – the Willpower roll could
involve a difficulty of 8 or maybe higher before you can shake
off your compulsion and focus on something else.
Phobia (2 or 3 pt. Flaw)
Irrational terror grips you whenever you face the subject of
your Phobia: crowds, heights, Black Suits, and so forth. Such
terror probably stems from psychic trauma, Social Processing,
or some other incident that carved its niche within your mind.
Although mages pride themselves upon their strength of will,
everybody’s got their weaknesses; this primal fear is one of yours.
The subject of your Phobia must be defined at the time this
Flaw is selected. Anytime you’re confronted with that situation,
make a Willpower roll or else flee that fearsome situation. Even if
you do succeed, you’ll need to roll at least three successes in order
to approach the object of your fears and deal with it head-on. The
Storyteller bases the difficulty of that roll upon the circumstances
of the encounter. An unexpected brush with a normal wolf spider
would rate a difficulty of 6 or 7 for an arachnophobe, while being
dropped into a pit full of titanic wolf spiders would be, shall we
say, somewhat higher. (Difficulty 9 or 10, you poor bastard.)
This Flaw has a three-point variation when applied to vampires and werekin; mages, however, are not subject to uncanny
frenzies the way such creatures are, and so the Flaw is worth
only two points to a mage or other non-frenzying character.
As an optional rule, the Storyteller may allow a character with
the Berserker Merit or the Stress Atavism or Beast Within
Flaws (pp. 53 and 92) to take this Flaw for three points, with
the character freaking out and destroying everything in her way
as she tries to escape if and when the Willpower roll is failed.
PTSD (2 to 5 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, p. 647-648.
Rose-Colored Glasses (2 pt. Flaw)
Known sardonically asRose-Colored Mirrorshadesamong
Technocracy operatives, this Flaw reflects a rather delusional
loyalty to your faction of choice. Essentially, your team can
do no wrong as far as you’re concerned. Their cause is just,
their paradigm unshakable, their deeds necessary under the
circumstances, no matter how extreme those deeds might be.
Your character views almost anything the group does in its most
favorable light… which, considering how awful Awakened groups
can be, means that you’re choosing to overlook a great deal.
Confronted with inconvenient truths, you can get downright
irrational, abusive, or even fanatical. If you’re ever confronted
with truths you cannot deny, avoid, or slander away, the shock
could devastate you for years to come – very possibly driving
you into the arms of a diametrically opposed faction for which
you’ll hold a similar sort of loyalty. (See Changing Focus and
Allegiance in Mage 20, p. 339.)
Vengeful (2 pt. Flaw)
They’ve hurt you, and now they’ll pay!Someone has committed
a crime you cannot and will not forgive, and whenever you get
the chance, you’ll shower them with red-hot vengeance. This
grudge has become your highest priority in life – everything else
is merely a distraction. You may put this quest for revenge aside
temporarily if you spend a Willpower point in order to do so.
Until the guilty parties have been punished, though, vengeance
drives you to become that most dangerous of creatures: a mage
on a mission that ends only with blood.
Short Fuse (2 pt. Flaw)
Anger management is not your strong suit. When something or someone pisses you off (which happens with distressing
regularity), you must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) or
else deal with that shit gloves-off style. You probably won’t
use deadly (or vulgar) force too recklessly, as you’re not long
for this world if you do. Your infamous temper, however, can
have severe long-term effects on your popularity, health, and
status among your peers and superiors… which is itself a lethal
proposition among members of the Technocratic Union and
other groups that pride themselves on self-control.
For a more extreme version of this Trait, see the Supernatural Flaw: Beast Within.
Absent-Minded (3 pt. Flaw)
Um… what was that thing you were trying to remember,
again? Damn… This Flaw reflects a scatterbrained sense of
memory and connection – nothing quite as dangerous as full
Derangement (Mage 20, pp. 648-650), but a distressing and
occasionally hazardous disconnection nonetheless.
System-wise, your Storyteller will often have you make
Intelligence rolls to recall things like names, faces, mission
details, and so forth. Story-wise, you’re forever drawing blanks,
mistaking people for other folks, scrambling data, leaving
projects half-finished (or totally abandoned), forgetting to
feed your familiar, and making potentially hazardous errors
in judgment. Although you won’t forget vital things like your
name, the elements of your magickal focus, or vital character
Traits (Talents, Abilities, and Knowledges), other stuff slips
your mind with frustrating regularity. And when that mind
commands the powers of True Magick, such slips can have
fatal consequences.
Bigot (3 pt. Flaw)
You really fucking hatethose people, whoever “those people”
happen to be. Those people probably don’t like you either. Okay,
maybe you don’t make your feelings obvious, but your conviction
that those people are inferior troublemakers who are Everything
Wrong with the World Goddammit comes through in your
actions and decisions even if you say nothing of the kind out
loud. Such prejudices determine your choice of friends and
enemies, guide your beliefs, influence your politics, and tend
to spill out at inconvenient times if you lose your temper. (SeeChapter One: Heroic Traits 51
Short Fuse, above.) You might end up changing your mind
someday, but for the moment, bigotry is the lens through which
you view your world… and especially for mages, that sort of
thing means quite a bit to the world at large.
Despite the conventional (and not inaccurate) view of bigots
as raging racists, sexists, and homophobes, supposedly liberal
people can be bigots too; the worst kinds of bigots, in fact, are
often self-righteous folks whose claims of open-mindedness
get undercut by a quiet yet implacable prejudice against those
people. Older versions of this Flaw rated it at only two points;
in the twenty-first century, however, bigotry is more likely to
get you in trouble if and when it’s revealed, especially on the
Internet or in mass media… unless, of course, you’re running
for president, or otherwise speaking up for folks who share
your views, in which case you become a saint to some people
and a demon to others.
It’s worth noting that bigots tend to have understandable
reasons for their prejudices. Those reasons could stem from
personal grievances, cultural bias, racial anxieties, scriptural
proclamations, psychic trauma, gender clashes, philosophical
paradigms, and – especially within Mage’s world – physical
and metaphysical distinctions between “us” and “them.” Those
reasons probably seem like bullshit to most people, but remain
perfectly justified to the bigot in question.
It’s also worth noting that this Flaw should not in any way
be taken as a license to abuse your fellow players. As with other mature-audience subjects, a character’s prejudices might become a
trigger for real-life tensions within the group, and should thus
be handled carefully, as described under the Problems and
Triggers sections of Mage 20, pp. 344-345.
Chronic Depression (3 pt Flaw)
Regardless of your external circumstances, you often feel
drawn toward despair. Everything seems overwhelming, pointless, and at best a fucking joke at the world’s expense. That
feeling pervades each aspect of your existence: your attitude,
your physical health, your relationships, and even – especially!
– your approach to magick and all its manifestations. (See the
Mage 20sections aboutFocus and the Arts,Resonance,Quiet,
and the Vidare perceptions of the Otherworlds.) TL/DR: It
really sucks to be you.
Often viewed as a purely psychological issue (“It’s all in
your pretty little head…”), chronic depression tends to be linked
to physiological Impediments, as in the Physical Flaw of that
name. This Flaw can also reflect the psychic aftermath of Paradox
backlashes, Quiet episodes, Things Man Was Not Meant to
Know, Mind-Sphere attacks, and other forms of trauma (breakups, violation, disaster, and the like), although trauma-induced
depression is most often a manifestation of the Flaw: PTSD,
referenced above. Regardless of its origins, the psychological
element of depression is inescapable. The emotional weight of
constant despair tends to sap physical vitality, which comes back
around and inspires more depression. No wonder chronically
depressed people have a hard time “living life to the fullest.”
On some days, just getting out of bed without falling into a
crying heap is a challenge.
Story-wise, this Flaw influences roleplaying and character
descriptions as suggested above. System-wise, it often requires
you to make a Willpower roll when your depressed character
needs to push himself beyond the depression. A successful roll
means that he acts without hindrance. A failed one adds +2 to
the difficulty of the primary task at hand, which could involve
Attributes from the Physical (depression drains vitality), Social
(undercuts relationships with other folks), or Mental (mental
fuzz) categories, depending upon the situation. A botched roll
means that the depression takes over and drops him into a
deep black pit of despair in which he’ll be stuck for hours or
even days at a time.
You can spend a Willpower point to shove depression
aside, avoiding this roll entirely. However, as anyone who
understands the analogy of spoons can attest, sooner or later
you run out of Willpower points. (For those who are not
familiar with the analogy, it’s the idea that you have a limited
number of spoons to use each day; every task demands that
you give up one spoon, and so you soon run out of spoons).
The fact that people tend to get frustrated with your Black
Cloud of Doom™ doesn’t exactly help matters much; hell,
you’re more frustrated with that shit than anybody else is!
So seriously – in all aspects of one’s life, Chronic Depressiontown is not a fun place to be… not even for fans of the
World of Darkness.
Deranged (3 or 5 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, p. 648-650.
Driving Goal (3 pt. Flaw)
Even by Awakened standards, you possess (or are possessed
by) a cause so intense that it drives every aspect of your life, up
to and including your beliefs about, and approach to, magick
and Ascension. This goal, sadly, is almost impossible to achieve
on an individual basis: the collapse of the Technocracy, the
return of the Old Ways, the fall of the industrialized era, and
so forth. As a mage, you actually could gather enough influence
to lead a larger movement that shifts Reality toward your goal.
More likely, you will break yourself against that goal, as so
many other mages have done before you… but hey, if a cause
is as worth fighting for as yours is, then it’s worth whatever
cost you must pay.
As a Flaw, this Driving Goal inspires roleplaying choices and informs your character’s focus, allegiance, magick,
Path, Resonance, Seekings, Paradox backlashes, and pretty
much everything else you can imagine. You can take short
breaks from your crusade (usually by spending a Willpower point in order to take a different road for a while), but
eventually this obsession brings you back to the goal you
must pursue at all costs until you finally accomplish it or
destroy yourself trying.52 The Book of Secrets
Extreme Kink (3 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Everyone’s a little kinky; your needs are more, shall we say,
exotic than a run-of-the-mill fetish. You might still adhere to the
third part of the BDSM mantra safe, sane, and consensual, but
your kink is neither safe nor sane by most people’s definition of
those words. We’re not talking about tame bondage-and-spanking
stuff – more like Fifty Shades of What the Fuck is Wrong with You?
Unlike the old Flaw: Sadism /Masochism (which it replaces),
this Flaw isn’t about the nature and specifics of your kink – it’s
about how much trouble you can get into trying to satisfy your
needs. A three-point kink can damage your health, reputation,
and play partners; a four-point kink can seriously harm you
(and whoever’s unfortunate enough to hook up with you), and
a five-point kink can get you prison time or worse. (Gods help
the people you choose to help you satisfy that kink…)
Certain mages are more prone to this Flaw than others,
especially if they favor Left-Hand Path-type practices. For what
ought to be obvious reasons, this is not an appropriate Flaw
for all chronicles or players, and may well invoke safewords and
blackouts from your Storyteller or companions. (See Mage 20,
p. 345.) Although this Flaw, like others of its kind, does not
bear a judgment on our part, this sort of thing can offend and
trigger other players, so don’t be a dick about it.
Feral Mind (3 pt. Flaw)
More animal than human being, you lack the social graces
and mental conditioning that most folks consider essential.
Perhaps you’re a throwback, or wild-raised since childhood; or
maybe you lost a part of yourself to animalistic shapechanging,
suffer from a mental or psychological quirk, or simply renounce
your humanity in favor of a more honest primal truth.
Regardless of its origins, this feral-mindedness limits your
ability to function in human society. You prefer non-linguistic
vocalizations and body language over cultured speech, and may
lack the ability to “speak” in human terms at all. Your actions
and reactions are animalistic too; you mark territory, snarl
when annoyed, cower or lash out when threatened, feel no
sense of so-called “modesty,” detest clothing, and smell musky
even when you’ve just had a bath (which you rarely do under
your own power). Such behaviors usually raise the difficulty of
your social-interaction rolls by +3, although certain situations
– like intimidation or seduction – may lower the difficulty by
the same amount (-3).
This Flaw, however, isn’t simply a social drawback; you
may not have more than three separate Language Merits,
and you speak very little (and very simply) when you choose
to speak at all. Your human developmental skills (speech,
reading, math, socialization, etc.) hover at a child-like level
despite your sharp instincts and innate primal cunning.
Although your Mental Attributes (especially Perception and
Wits) may be high, you probably won’t ever reach an adult
level of human development; even if you do, the animal in
you remains very close to the skin.
Flashbacks (3 pt. Flaw)
Sudden flashes of sensory trauma haunt you constantly.
These might be legacies of psychoactive drug use, visions of
a past or future incarnation, kickbacks from PTSD (see the
Flaw of that name), echoes of Quiet, all-too-vivid memories,
Things Man was Not Meant to Know… in short, they could
be anything that floods your mind with bursts of unexpected
impressions that overwhelm your current circumstances.
High-stress situations can trigger such hallucinations – and
since mages essentially live in high-stress situations, this Flaw can
be a fairly nasty one. The stress in question doesn’t have to be a
bad experience, although itdoestend to be the bad days that bring
such things out in the worst way possible. You might see your
loved one’s face start to melt in a moment of passion… or feel the
branding irons that seared your flesh in a past life burn their way
into your skin during an argument with your boss. Heavy traffic
could become a roller coaster, and the exam you’re taking might
morph into a living page of laughing cartoons. Flashbacks don’t
have to make sense, and they often don’t. They can, however,
blot out your true surroundings unless you successfully make a
Willpower roll (difficulty 8) to shake them off.
Thankfully, flashbacks don’t often last long. By the time
you realize that you’re not dodging HIT Marks in the ruins of
Concordia, though, you may have driven off the road, punched
your best friend, shat your pants, or run like a maniac through
downtown Seattle without realizing that it was all in your head…
this time, anyway.
Hatred (3 pt. Flaw)
As with Bigot, above, you utterly despise some source of
hatred. Maybe you loathe vampires, werebeasts, rich or homeless
people, fae folk, spirits, dogs, trucks, machines, TV, lawyers,
witches, cops, politicians… whatever it is that you hate, you hate
it a lot, and will take advantage of any opportunity to hinder
or harm the object of your hostility.
Like a bigot, you have what you consider to be a perfectly
rational reason for hating whatever it is you despise. Other folks
probably consider you crackers unless they share your point
of view – in which case, they might become disciples instead.
(See the Backgrounds: Allies, Backup, Cult, Influence and
Retainers.) As with aDriving Goal, this Flaw guides roleplaying
choices, determines targets, and makes you seem rather obsessive whenever the object of aversion comes into play. Because
fear and hatred are so closely intertwined, chances are good
that you’ve got a Short Fuse and /or a Phobia related to this
Flaw. And if you also have Berserker /Stress Atavism or Beast
Within, then you need to make a Willpower roll (difficulty 8)
when confronted head-on with the thing you abhor, or else
lose your proverbial shit in its general direction.
Obviously, this Flaw must be chosen carefully. If your character tends to go thermonuclear at, say, the police on an ongoing
basis, he is in for a very rough (and probably short) life indeed.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 53
Lifesaver (3 pt. Flaw)
Life, to you, is a gift and miracle worth saving. As far as you’re
concerned, even the most wretched people are worth another
chance at redemption, and so you go out of your way to save lives
and improve the lot of people (human and otherwise) who need
a leg up in this world. More than a simple “code verses killing,”
this Trait gives you a moral imperative to salvage lives, not just
a reason to not end them. In short, it makes you a big-hearted,
generous person who deeply believes in the sanctity (whether
you would use that religious term or not) of life. And that, in the
World of Darkness, is a magnificent burden to bear.
OCPD (3 pt. Flaw)
Mages tend to be kinda obsessive by nature. You, however,
feel compelled to follow stringent personal rituals, maintain an
obsessive sense of order, work yourself to the point of exhaustion
(and beyond), organize every possible element of your life and
space, employ compulsive behaviors without realizing that you’re
doing so, and otherwise lose track of time, things, and people
unless they fall into the sphere of your obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.
An especially common Flaw among technomancers, scientists, ritual magi, religious devotees, autistic people, military
personnel, artists, executives, and other folks whose philosophies
and pursuits demand continual attention, OCPD could also
result from various forms of psychic trauma, brain damage,
spiritual epiphanies, cultural or professional perfectionism,
and metaphysical dedication. As a rule, a person’s behaviors
grow more compulsive when he’s under stress. After all, when
it seems like your world’s spinning out of control, it becomes
all the more important to establish control over whatever
elements you can control.
When this Flaw is chosen, you’ll need to define which
compulsions your character has, and figure out the triggers
that make those compulsions more obvious. System-wise, you’ll
often have to make Willpower rolls in order to shake off the
need to organize and obsess over the object of your attentions.
The difficulty, of course, depends upon the situation and the
character’s level of stress at the time; the more challenging the
circumstances, the more obsessive the compulsions.
Stress Atavism (4 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, p. 644, and the Merit: Berserker.
Ability Deficit (5 pt. Flaw)
For whatever reason, you have fallen short of your potential.
Maybe you’re too young to have learned a lot about life (an
excellent reason for a child-mage to have this Flaw); or you’ve
led a sheltered existence, honing your Knowledges but lacking
in Talents. You could be a construct who only recently left the
lab, or too physically frail to have mastered much in the way
of Talents or Skills. There’s certainly some story-based reason
for your deficient Traits, and that cause will have other effects
on the chronicle as well.
In game terms, this Flaw subtracts five points from one
of your Ability categories (Talents, Skills, or Knowledges),
and limits your starting Traits in that category to three dots
or fewer even if /when you spend freebie points to raise them.
(You may, of course, raise them after the chronicle has begun.)
As noted above, this makes a good Flaw for Awakened kids,
constructs, and other folks who haven’t been able to “be all
that you can be” just yet.

Social Merits
Although mages aren’t always among the most sociable
of creatures, certain Awakened folk lean heavily upon the
company of friends and fellow-travelers. And so, Merits that
help a character move more easily through social circles can be
pretty valuable. Especially in the twenty-first century, a mage
of any sort can use all the friends they can get.
Loyalty (1 pt. Merit)
You’re especially devoted to a certain cause, group, creed
or person. When someone tries to turn you against the object
of your loyalty, you receive a two-die bonus to your dice pool
when resisting that attempt with your Willpower. If the assault
uses your Willpower Trait as the difficulty for the attack, then
your attacker adds +2 to her difficulty while striving to undermine your loyalty. (See the feat Resisting on the Dramatic
Feats chart in Mage 20, p. 403, and the Mind Sphere entry
in the same book, p. 519.)
Naturally, you must define the source and reasons for your
devotion when you select this Merit. Such loyalty will influence
many of your roleplaying choices too – your friends, enemies,
priorities, magickal focus, and other things besides. For extra
fun (ha ha), you can complement this Merit with the Flaw:
Conflicting Loyalties, described below.
Family Support (1 to 3 pt. Merit)
Your family knows about your Awakened life – and for the
most part, they approve of it. You might belong to an ancestral
“fam trad” (a family tradition of magical /occult pursuits), a
supportive New Ager-type of clan, an appropriately religious
family (that is, relatives who follow the same creed as you do),
a wealthy dynasty that backs your current life-choices, and so
on. This family could be your proverbial “family of origin”
(your blood relations), an adopted “family of choice” (people
who are not your genetic kin but who function as your family
now), or both. Either way, your family stands behind you. This
Merit doesn’t extend to major economic help unless you also
purchase the appropriate Backgrounds too (Resources, Retainers, and so on). Still, it’s good to have someplace to call home,
and someone to be there when you need them.
The more influential your family, and the more supportive
of you they are, the more this Merit costs:54 The Book of Secrets
• (1 point) You’ve got a “typical” family for your culture,
and their support is mostly emotional although you can
get a few bucks, a favor, and a place to crash when you
need it.
• (2 points) Your family has status, wealth, and influence.
While they expect you to stand on your own for the most
part, you can still get help if and when you need some.
• (3 points) A scion of wealth, power, and privilege, you
can call upon favors and influence when need be. Your
clan pulls strings on your behalf even when you don’t
ask for help, and people defer to you because of your
heritage.
As anyone who’s been born into a wealthy yet dysfunctional clan can attest, you can have both Family Support and
Family Issues (as the Flaw described below). Your rich dad
could be an abusive prick, your loving uncle might be creepily
possessive, and Mom’s support comes with more strings than
a puppeteer’s convention. Both Traits could also represent a
character whose family of origin is a mess, but whose family
of choice supports her.
For the purposes of coincidental magick, a family reflected
in this Merit does not count as Sleeper witnesses when their
beloved mage casts Effects. That benefit doesn’t usually extend
to your companions, however, unless they employ the same
sort of focus as you do, use magick that fits into your family’s
world-view, or purchase this Merit to reflect being “adopted”
into your family as a childhood friend, a spouse, or an otherwise
beloved part of the clan.
Favor (1 to 3 pt. Merit)
Also known as a Boon, this Merit means that somebody owes you, big-time. You scratched their back, and will
eventually call in some scratching of your own in due time.
Maybe you aided a Master-level mage… or helped a vampire
prince… or did a solid for a wealthy Sleeper, a spirit, a faerie,
or a ranking member of the Changing Breeds. Regardless
of their identity, this party is more powerful than you are,
and can get things done on your behalf that you could not
get done yourself.
The value of this Merit depends upon the value of that
favor. Minor acts of benevolence cost one point, significant
boons are worth two, and a life-debt is worth three. You
may purchase several Favors, either from a single party
or from several different folks who owe you. A Storyteller
may grant this Merit in place of experience points if your
character has helped a supporting character and requested,
earned or demanded a Favor in return. Once that favor has
been performed, however, the Merit is spent. Long-lasting
assistance would be counted as a Background like Mentor
or Patron, or as one of the allies described in the section
about Supernatural Merits.
Pitiable (1 pt. Merit)
Oh, you poor thing! People want to help you, and you’re
willing to let them do so. Although this Merit lowers the
difficulty of your social rolls by -2 when you’re trying to get
someone to take care of you, it adds +2 to the difficulty of rolls
that attempt to intimidate people or otherwise impress folks
into taking you seriously.
Prestigious Mentor (1 pt. Merit)
Your Mentor (as in the Background Trait of that name)
has a reputation that benefits you as well. When you’re making social rolls to invoke your influential teacher, reduce the
difficulty by -2. Of course, some folks will be somewhat less
than impressed; for rolls that involve rivals or enemies of your
mentor, add +2 to the difficulty unless that mentor scares the
shit out of them… in which case, you had damned well better
be able to live up to the fear his name invokes!
Regal Bearing (1 pt. Merit)
Aristocratic charisma is your birthright. Although you
might not actually hail from a noble family, your presence radiates dignity. Posture, features, tone of voice, aura of dominion
– you’re got them all. People defer to you as a reflex; subtract
-2 from the difficulty of your Social-Trait rolls whenever you’re
trying to make an impression, and while certain folks will want
to take you down a few pegs on general principle, most people
are inclined to respect you even if they don’t necessarily like you.
Unobtrusive (1 pt. Merit)
You can pass without notice in most social situations. This
is less about the uncanny Background: Arcane (although it can
complement that Background) than it is a matter of simply
seeming unremarkable. Unless you make a fuss of some kind,
folks just don’t remember you. You’re… um, that dude… or
that girl… or, well, damn, I don’t even remember exactly what
sort of person you are, actually. And in some lines of work or
walks of life, this is a very useful talent to have.
Although it does not in any way render you invisible or
untraceable, this Merit lets you blend in and slip from memory.
Folks need to make a Perception roll (difficulty 6) in order to
recall your features or name. On the flipside, you add +2 to the
difficulty of any social rolls you need to make, because folks
just don’t notice you under most circumstances. For obvious
reasons, you can’t take any socially distinctive Merits, Flaws or
Backgrounds – such Traits would make you memorable – or have
especially distinctive features or clothing. Granted, “distinctive”
depends upon who and where you are; the proverbial gray flannel
suit, for example, stands out at places like Burning Man! Under
most circumstances, though, you blend in wherever you go.
Animal Magnetism (2 pt. Merit)
Though it might not involve conventionally good looks, you
possess a primal sort of attractiveness. Your social rolls subtract
-2 from their difficulty when you’re trying to charm, seduce, orChapter One: Heroic Traits 55
otherwise impress folks by appealing to their carnal natures.
This benefit doesn’t usually apply to threats or intimidation
attempts, although clever applications of raw sex appeal can be
rather unnerving, which could facilitate rather effective threats…
Confidence (2 pt. Merit)
You exude an aura of unshakable authority. Nothing seems
to rattle you. Folks defer to you by default, and you expect
nothing less. Even when you’re making things up off the top
of your head, or lying your ass off about your true feelings or
intentions, your self-confidence inspires an unusual degree of
trust. Cool is your middle name, and the few people who try to
get one over on you have a very hard time doing so.
When dice start falling, subtract -2 from the difficulty of
all social rolls based upon impressing other characters with your
capabilities. Other players, however – the Storyteller included
– add +2 to the difficulty of social rolls for characters who try
to shake your confidence or shatter your calm.
Hideaway /Safehouse (2, 4 or 6 pt. Merit)
When you need time to yourself, there’s a place you can
go to that no one knows about except you. It’s small, yeah,
and remote enough that your friends and enemies can’t find
you there. Chances are, it’s a secret apartment or condo, a
distant cottage, a mobile home, or a literal cave or grove or
camping spot where you go to escape the stress of your usual
life. It could even be a pocket Realm, accessible only to you
and whomever you choose to share it with, should you be
foolish enough to trust anyone else with this secret hideaway.
Unless you give its location away, however, or wind up getting
tracked to it by a dedicated stalker, this little getaway is your
personal escape hatch. Use it wisely, and be careful when
you come and go!
Unlike the Merit:Property(see below), or the Backgrounds:
Chantry,Node, andSanctum, this discrete hidey-hole isn’t expansive, elaborate, or innately magickal. That said, it’s hidden from
most forms of casual detection. You could combine this Merit
with Property, Node or Sanctum, although those Traits would
need to be purchased in addition to your Hideaway, and their
existence must remain secret from other characters. Chantries
are social by default, and so cannot also become a Hideaway.
This place is stocked up with whatever you would need for a
roughly two-week stay, and may, of course, be stocked up for
longer periods if you bring in additional supplies. Although you
might be traced to your hideaway with magick or other tracking
methods, your little retreat is not linked to you by any searchable
official channels: bills, lease, mail, Internet services, etc.
Once per story – if events occur which could lead other
people to your hideaway, if you do something that could
reveal its location, or if someone dedicates time and effort56 The Book of Secrets
trying to track you down – the Storyteller may roll two dice
against difficulty 6. (Yes, this roll is done in secret, so you
won’t know the results.) If that roll gets at least one success,
then your secret remains hidden; one failure means that
someone has gotten a clue but not your exact whereabouts;
four successive failures reveal the location of your hideaway,
and a botch on that roll exposes its location immediately. So
long as you continue to cover your tracks, however, this place
remains yours and yours alone.
For four points, this Merit could also be purchased under the name Safehouse. In this case, it’s a secured getaway
that features better facilities and protections than a typical
Hideaway. Its store of supplies can provide for a dozen or
so people for roughly two months, and the Merit includes
a small dedicated staff (in game terms, two dots in Retainers or four dots in Backup) to maintain that site. Unlike a
Hideaway, this area can withstand a minor-league assault,
and features up to three offices /work areas, reinforced
walls, bulletproof glass, and a vault-like panic room. This
safehouse also includes a shielded communications array
(-2 to attempts to hack or trace that system), and a simple
but effective alarm and security camera system (again, -2 to
subversion attempts). The downside is that the Merit is not
your property; it belongs to your superiors, and can be taken
away from you if you fall out with the folks who foot the bill
for it. Generally, a Technocrat in good standing with her
superiors can get a Safehouse Merit (or, for especially good
service, be awarded with one), but other mages could obtain
a similar facility as well.
For six points, your refuge can be both a Safehouse and
a Hideaway; in this case, the property belongs entirely to you.
Enjoy your Batcave, Mr. Wayne!
Natural Leader (2 pt. Merit)
Inspiring by nature, you’re the sort of person other people
look to for guidance. As a result, your Leadership-based dice
pools receive a two-die bonus. Obviously, you need a certain
level of presence to inspire such loyalty, and so you must have
three dots or more in your Charisma Attribute before you can
hope to be such a commanding individual.
Officially Dead (2 pt. Merit)
According to the authorities, you’re no longer among
the living. Perhaps you’ve successfully faked your own death,
or had it faked for you when you assumed a new identity. An
especially common Merit among Technocratic operatives, Hermetic magi, and the Chakravanti, this erasure of your former
life is often a required part of service within the New World
Order, Iteration X, and certain Houses of Hermes. As far as
your family, government, and old friends are concerned, you’re
six feet under. Naturally, you’ll need to be discreet about your
continued existence if you don’t want that death to become
more permanent.
Perfect Liar (2 pt. Merit)
Oh gods, you’re good at lying! Falsehoods slide from your
tongue like water off a vine leaf, and even the folks who know
you well tend to be taken in when you start talking. You also
lack the usual “tells” that betray a liar: your vital signs remain
stable, your eyes don’t twitch, and your voice never falters.
Unless someone is outright reading your mind (as in, using
Mind-Sphere magick or some other paranormal power), you still
often appear to be telling the truth; even then, the mind-reader
might assume that you at least believe you’re telling the truth!
Story-wise, people usually believe what you say when you’re
lying about small, casual things that are not immediately, obviously false. With regards to the dice, reduce the difficulty by -2
when you’re trying to lie about something important. Again,
this Merit will not alter auras or change the thoughts in your
head, although those folks who can’t actively monitor your soul
will be inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt. (Suckers…)
Prestige (2 pt. Merit)
Also known as Reputation, this Merit reveals you as an
honored personage within your Tradition, Convention, Craft,
or another sort of sect. Among your peers, you add three extra
dice to all social rolls used to influence folks within that group.
Story-wise, allies of your group will tend to like you, and rivals
or enemies will tend to… not.
When you first select this Merit, decide upon the source
of this prestige. Perhaps you earned it through deeds before the
chronicle began, or won the Merit in place of experience points.
It might represent an honored lineage to which you belong,
or reflect a glorious mentor whose rep rubs off on you. Either
way, folks expect great things of you, and usually defer to you
so long as you live up to the reputation you currently enjoy.
For the flipside of this Merit, see the Social Flaw: Infamy,
pp. 62-63.
Property (2 to 5 pt. Merit)
You’ve got a decent-sized piece of property that, while
non-magickal, is certainly useful: a manor house, a farm, a
nightclub, bookstore, restaurant, grove, and so forth. The
larger and more prosperous the property, the more points
this Merit costs. Elsewhere known as the Merits: Nightclub
and Mansion, this Merit demands a minimum rating in the
Background: Resources, as noted below.
• (2 points) A relatively small property of roughly 3000
square feet /900 meters, with perhaps – if it’s a business
– a trickle of income that slightly exceeds its expenses.
Examples: a nice house, a comic store, a coffee shop, a
penthouse apartment, etc. Minimum Resources: 3
• (3 points) A rather sweet place with dedicated servants
/staffers, all necessary facilities (sewer, trash, Internet
connection, etc.), and – if it’s a business – an income
that contributes to your Resources Background.Examples:Chapter One: Heroic Traits 57
A nightclub, a mansion, a small farm, a radio station, a
large store, and so forth. Minimum Resources: 4
• (4 points) A substantial location, staffed with skilled
(though mundane) employees and connected to an acre
or two of associated land. Examples: A small office building, a family manor, an arena, a school, a medium-sized
farm, a vineyard, a small laboratory, a library, and the
like. At this level, it could also represent several smaller,
two-point Properties as well. Minimum Resources: 5
• (5 points) An impressive holding that features an extensive staff and a fair amount of property. Examples: An
office complex, a stadium, a college, a major laboratory,
a shopping center, an archive, and so forth. This level
could reflect a number of two-point or three-point
Properties, too. Minimum Resources: 6
Although this Merit, by itself, is in no way magickal or hypertech-equipped, your Property could provide the base of operations
for the Backgrounds: Allies, Backup, Chantry, Cult, Library,
Node, Resources, Retainers, Sanctum, and even Spies. (Baristas overhear a lot of crazy stuff…) Unless you’ve got a dedicated
manager for the Property, it also demands a certain amount
of time and attention, and quickly falls into disrepair and /or
bankruptcy if you leave it alone for a week or more while jaunting
off on various adventures. Property also tends to attract interest
from parties both mundane and otherwise, especially if there’s
an ongoing rivalry with competing businesses, family enemies,
an archnemesis, and so on. Cops take a dim view of wild stuff
going down on your property, and the insurance costs can be
murder if (read:when) your place gets trashed by extradimensional
entities, HIT Marks, or raging Ascension Warriors.
Unless they’re part of the Backgrounds: Allies, Backup,
Cult, or Retainers, employees of your Property Merit do count
as Sleeper witnesseswith regards to magickal deeds on and around
such properties.
Research Grant (2 pt. Merit)
You’ve been given a prestigious grant from a foundation,
an academy, a corporation, or some other moneyed institution.
This stipend frees you from the burdens of a regular job, and
although it’s probably not a large amount of money, it’ll keep
you in rent and ramen for a while… so long as you don’t piss
off your sponsors.
This grant also includes a certain degree of privileged
access to archives and facilities that are connected to your field
of endeavor. And yeah – it’s got some strings, too. You need to
report your findings on a regular basis, suck up to the necessary
authorities, and behave in a manner that reflects well upon your
sponsors. In many cases (especially for corporate endowments),
said sucking up includes reporting what your sponsors want
to hear, not necessarily what your research actually reveals.
Failure to please your supporters tends to result in the loss of
said endowment. Isn’t research wonderful?
Sanctity (2 pt. Merit)
Although you might not actually be innocent, you project
an impression of purity. People trust you even if you’re not
trustworthy, and they’re inclined to think of you as some sort
of paragon. Naturally, this can be an almighty pain in the
ass too. When you get in trouble, though (and you will), the
authorities will almost certainly go easy on you, friends will
aid you, and even strangers may come to your defense because
you couldn’t possibly be guilty of what you’re accused of doing!
Secret Code Language (2 pt. Merit)
Language itself is a series of codes; folks who’ve been
initiated into it (that is, folks who’ve learned the language) are
considered members of the society in question. Some languages,
however, are more exclusive and secretive than others. This
Merit reflects your knowledge of a particular code known to
only the “right people.”
Mages are secretive by nature, and so mage society is full of
secret codes. Even Sleepers, though, have their own initiatory
languages: military jargon, the Language of Flowers, various
hand-signals, ciphers, and passwords employed by people who
need to communicate with each other in ways no one outside
their group can understand… except, perhaps, for those who’ve
learned those codes through some “unauthorized” source.
As with the Merit: Language (p. 44), this Merit confers
knowledge of a particular communication mode, which might
not be in any way verbal. It could involve hand-signals, body
postures, artwork, flags, symbolism, numbers, and so on. To
uninitiated observers, that language appears to be gibberish
(a word, incidentally, that refers to the coded writings of the
alchemist Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan); in many cases, a coded
method of communication appears completely mundane unless
you know what to look for, as with the encrypted artwork in
The DaVinci Code.
One vital caveat: A character must have a very good in-game
reason for knowing the things she knows. Learning a Secret
Code Language requires some story-based foundation for that
knowledge: elite military training, mind-reading, time among
the group in question, etc. Fortunately, code languages tend to
be utilitarian, revealing essential things in a general manner.
(“I’m hungry,” “Kill him,” “This area’s forbidden,” etc.) Even so,
codes may have subtleties that aren’t readily apparent; a single
gesture or stressed syllable might mark the difference between
Knock him out and move on quickly and Torture him to his least
breath, no matter how long it takes.
Socially Networked (2 pt. Merit)
Well-Connected on the Internet (as in the Virtual Adept
Merit of that name), you enjoy a high online profile – a website, at least one blog, more Twitter followers and Facebook
friends than you could possibly meet in Meatspace, and so on.
When you post, folks read, share, and take it seriously. While
this might or might not translate into folks you know in the58 The Book of Secrets
Digital Web (and really – would you want it to?), you command
global influence via the World Wide Web. As a result, you’ve
got the sort of influence and resources that most folks cannot
imagine: crowdfunding backers, instant information, places
to crash all over the world if and when you want them… the
details depend upon the sort of presence you maintain and
the people you attract, but they go beyond anything you could
accomplish without the Internet.
Of course, you could fuck things up on a grand scale if
you’re not careful – such attention can backfire on you if you
post the wrong thing at the wrong time – and certain haters
despise you on general principle. Considering that the Internet
is a prime front in twenty-first century reality wars, though,
this sort of network can provide a major edge for your side.
Subculture Insider (2 pt. Merit)
You’re innately familiar with a social environment that
most folks never visit, much less understand. They know you
there, and so even when you haven’t met a given person (human
or otherwise) in that environment, they consider you to be an
insider. Thanks to your familiarity, you can navigate certain
elements of the physical environment there too – the security
apparatuses, the “secret handshakes,” the hidden corners that
an insider would know about and an outsider would never think
to look for, and other obstacles that a subculture puts into place
to make certain that only the “right” people can get around.
When moving through your subculture of choice, subtract -2
from the difficulties of rolls that grant social or physical access
to that subculture’s established turf.
The subculture in question can be any kind of exclusive
social environment that also includes the physical surroundings
employed by that particular group: country clubs, drug cartels,
the international mercenary network, the global espionage underworld, high-level finance executives, the fetish community,
homeless transient communities, clannish rural communities,
hip-hop networks, the jet set, rave festival culture, fantasy fans,
the touring road-dog musical community, world financial leaders,
“gypsy” Travelers, and so on. Although it can include mages and
other Night-Folk, the community must be essentially “mortal” in
terms of the majority of insiders. You can buy this Merit several
times to reflect membership in several different communities.
That insider status, however, takes time to acquire and a lot of
attention to maintain. If you neglect your community, you’ll
soon find those familiar doors slammed in your face.
Dark Triad (3 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 643.
Local Hero (3 pt. Merit)
You’ve done great things for your community, and people
love you for it. You might have cleaned out the resident drug
dealers, defied slumlords, established a halfway house or a
center of worship – whatever it was that you did for the Masses,
you get free food, “friends of the house” discounts, places to
crash (possibly with happy bedmates!), and other offerings of
thanks from the people you have helped.
Also known as Folk Hero, this Merit reflects your popularity among the local Sleepers. You reduce the difficulty of
your social rolls by -2 when you’re dealing with the people of
your community, and receive constant aid and respect from
those people whenever you need them. The catch, of course,
is that you must live up to your heroic reputation; turn your
back on these grateful souls, or take their goodwill for granted,
and you’ll be “yesterday’s hero” in no time.
Noted Messenger (3 pt. Merit)
A known emissary between groups, you’re treated with
a certain amount of deference and courtesy that other mages
would not receive. Even enemies of your group won’t try
to kill you on general principle, though they might not be
especially happy to see you. The things you have to say will
be given a certain amount of weight, and your presence may
open doors (literal or otherwise) that would remain shut for
almost anybody else.
That’s the upside; the downside is that you need to behave
yourself (and keep a tight leash on your companions) when
you’re on someone else’s turf. Passing false messages will undermine your credibility, and obnoxious behavior will get that
welcome mat yanked out from under your feet rather quickly.
It should go without saying that breaking a truce while acting
in your official capacity (or even when you’re not!) will trash
your reputation and reflect very poorly on your superiors.
Also… well, some folks really do prefer to kill the messenger
when things don’t go their way. Tread that red carpet carefully.
Rising Star (3 pt. Merit)
Within your group, you’re an up-and-coming luminary.
Your superiors favor you, your peers respect you, handfuls of
haters despise you (of course!), and folks who pay attention
to the group’s activities have noticed your progress, and they
approve. Many people within your group go out of their way to
be your friend, and plum assignments keep coming your way.
When dealing with members of your Tradition, Convention or
whatever, subtract -1 from the difficulties of your social rolls,
unless those rolls are meant to influence folks who want to
see you fail. People are, of course, expecting great things from
you, so don’t let them down…
Ties (3 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, pp. 643-644.
Master of Red Tape (4 pt. Merit)
A savant of bureaucracy, you slash your way through
official obstructionism. When red tape unspools across your
path, you know who to talk to, which forms to fill out, and
where the loopholes are. A few calls to the right people, and
official obstacles disappear as if by magic(k). After all, it’s not
what you ask for but who you ask, and how.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 59
When faced with the near-inevitable morass of bureaucracy, subtract -2 from all difficulties that involve dealing with the
system. To use this Merit, you need to decide what you want
to accomplish and how you want to go about doing that. Your
character makes the requisite calls to the requisite people, and
the dice determine the rest. Backgrounds likeAlternate Identity,
Backup,Certification,Contacts,Influence,Rank,Requisitions,
Retainers, Secret Weapons, and Spies often involve bureaucracies, and Allies, Chantry, Resources, and other Backgrounds
might feature red tape if the Background in question comes from
a larger organization. Although it’s most helpful for members of
the Technocratic Union, any modern mage can find this Merit
useful. Hermetic Chantries are infamous for byzantine bureaucracy, and the courts of classical China pretty much invented
such things, making this an appropriate Merit for Wu Lung and
certain monastic Akashayana.
True Love (4 pt. Merit)
In spite of epic tragedies around you, you’ve found True
Love – the kind that folks make movies, songs, and ballads about.
Whenever things look bleak, Love can pull you through. This
capital-L Love is not defined by gender, culture, anatomy, or
even species… though that last one might make things difficult
for your star-crossed relationship. For extra drama, it could be a
forbidden romance: a cyborg, for example, in love with a Cultist,
or a straight-laced Chorister whose soulmate teeters on the brink of
being Fallen (see also the Flaw: Sleeping with the Enemy, p. 66).
System-wise, this Merit – which exists in a crux between
the Social and Supernatural realms – gives you one automatic
success on all Willpower rolls, which can be negated only by a
botch. (Magick-casting rolls do not apply, although the success
does apply if someone’s trying to influence your character with
Mind magick.) Your True Love will move heaven and earth to
help you, and other folks might do a Princess Bride if and when
they discover that you’ve got True Love on your side. Note,
of course, that said Princess Bride-ism usually involves people
making the Path of True Love even more difficult for you, too.
Such hardships are the reason so many tales revolve around
True Love. You shall, by all the gods, have a very dramatic life…
as per the Chapter Five Genres, Storytelling, and Mage entries
for Romance and Tragedy! (See pp. 285-286.)
Social Flaws
Despite all their enlightenment – and sometimes because
of it – mages can be rather clueless when it comes to social
niceties. Oh, sure, they can be cool as a vampire, smooth as an
oil slick, and more connected than a World Bank conference;
even then, however, a mage can make plenty of gaffes, enemies,
and other social pitfalls. And when that happens, you get stuff
like the following Social Flaws.
Blacklisted (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Having crossed some Powers That Be, you’ve now been
pariah-fied among some segment of the Masses. The results
impact your employment potential, social standing, legal status,
credit rating, background checks, rental possibilities, and other
significant elements of existing in the everyday world.
Originally presented as an Adversarial Background forCertification, this Flaw affects your regional, national, and perhaps
international official status. The degree to which you’ve been
professionally shunned depends upon the value of this Flaw:
• (1 point) Trivial – poor driving record, suspected shoplifter, banned from a local union.
• (2 points) Minor – misdemeanor criminal record, suspended license.
• (3 points) Significant – disbarred lawyer, defrocked clergy,
unpopular political affiliation, dishonorable military
discharge.
• (4points) Major – convicted felon, registered sex offender,
government watch-list, revoked medical license.
• (5 points) Pariah – FBI’s most-wanted, suspected terrorist,
convicted pedophile, declared legally incompetent or insane.
A four- or five-point Blacklisting will also wind up in the
Technocracy’s supervision database – a very dangerous place
for a mage to be! And although the Awakened don’t typically
check in with mundane authorities before recruiting or making
alliances with their own kind, a mage who’s had major problems
with such authorities is likely to have problems with mages too…
especially if such problems include offenses like terrorism or
pedophilia, which certain mages take very, very poorly.
Compulsive Speech (1 to 2 pt. Flaw)
Dude, please just shut up! But no, you just keep talking…
and talking… and talking some more. This compulsion could
come from a nervous social habit, a know-it-all personality, a
sense of awkwardness in silence, or some other (potentially
metaphysical) urge to fill up space with words. Worse still, those
words often feature rude observations, sensitive information,
and other stuff that’s best left unsaid. Day-um – did you just
say what I think you just said? Yep. You did. Arg…
As far as this Flaw is concerned, the one-point version
means you run at the mouth too much, while the two-point
one (also known as Big Mouth) means you say the wrong things
to the wrong people on a fairly regular basis, often to people
who sit higher than you do on the proverbial totem pole, or
who do not exactly have your best interests at heart. You can
spend a Willpower point to keep your mouth shut for a scene
or two; sooner or later, though, the words start flowing again…
Conflicting Loyalties (1 to 3 pt. Flaw)
Though deeply loyal (probably to the point of having the
Merit: Loyalty – see p. 53), you’re facing a crisis of commitments: two or more of the parties you feel loyal to are at odds
with one another, and you’re caught in the middle trying to60 The Book of Secrets
support them all. Your best friend could be in trouble with
the police force your father worked for; your lover may have
betrayed the trust of your Convention; your Allies may have
decided that your Mentor has to go. And so there you are –
poised in an impossible situation, attempting to do the right
thing for everyone involved.
The value of this Flaw, as always, depends upon the intensity of the conflict:
• (1 point) A minor crisis forces you to shuttle between
loyalties while remaining true to all parties.
• (2 points) A significant clash leads you to mediate untenable situations with frustrating frequency.
• (3 points) Irreconcilable differences will eventually
compel you to choose between loyalties, and that’s not a
choice you’re sure you can make. Until that time, you’re
fighting an apparently doomed campaign to support all
sides without betraying anyone.
The nature of your loyalties, relationships, and disputes
should, of course, be worked out when you take this Flaw. Your
Storyteller will make sure to bring them into play often enough
to keep you scrambling for the best solution to an apparently
impossible dilemma.
Conniver (1 pt. Flaw)
As far as most folks who know you are concerned, you’re a
perpetual knife in someone else’s back. That rep might not be
accurate (see the Flaws:Cultural Other,Infamy,Troublemaker,
and Profiled Appearance), but people expect treachery from
you even if they’re wrong to think so. Subtract one die from
any non-magickal dice pool you employ when you’re trying to
get other characters to trust you. This penalty does not extend
to Arete dice pools when you’re casting Mind-Sphere magick
(or any other Sphere’s magick, for that matter), but if you’re
having to cast spells in order to be believed, then you’ve kinda
just lived up to that reputation.
Cultural Other (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
In the eyes of your society, you’re clearly divergent. Disreputable. Other. People suspect you of criminal, or at least
unsavory, behavior; the authorities harass or detain you for little
or no reason, and your loved ones probably “wish you could
just be like normal people.” Granted, every mage is “other” to
some degree. In your case, though, the othering threatens your
life, liberty, and happiness.
Also known as Mistreated Minority, this Flaw reflects
prejudice within your society. The amount of trouble it causes, and the frequency of said trouble, determines the value of
your Flaw:
• (1 point) Folks around you tend to harass you in small
but noticeable ways (acting uncommonly brusque, using
slurs in your presence, taking uncomfortable liberties
with your privacy, property or person, etc.) and seem to
feel there’s nothing wrong with that at all. Other people
might stand up for you, but more often than not they
won’t.
• (2 points) As above, but now your family and other intimate companions feel that you deserve to be avoided,
shamed, insulted, and so forth because you are who or
what you are.
• (3 points) Strangers feel free to shame, insult, avoid,
and perhaps physically attack you on general principle.
Authorities might intervene, but probably won’t do so
unless major laws are broken… and maybe not even
then.
• (4 points) Authorities discriminate against you too. Your
house may be searched, your job may be terminated,
you might be evicted, robbed or assaulted and very few
people will care.
• (5 points) Merely living in this society is physically,
socially, emotionally, and legally hazardous to your
safety, your sanity, and possibly your life. You could be
imprisoned, enslaved, tortured or killed with little-or-no
response from the authorities.
Unlike the physical Flaw: Profiled Appearance, this
discrimination isn’t based on physicality. A character with
this Flaw cannot also take the Profiled Appearance Flaw; if your
character stands out physically while also being discriminated
against socially, simply take more points in this Flaw.
Nor is this Flaw tied to any particular creed, gender or
ethnicity; while a Wiccan could be a Cultural Other in a town
filled with fundamentalist Baptists, a fundamentalist Baptist
could be a Cultural Other in a Wicca-based Horizon Realm.
You could follow a “heretical” creed, belong to a “disreputable”
subculture, identify as a sexual /gender /ethnic /religious “minority,” hold an unpopular political opinion… anything that
inspires others around you to treat you poorly and get away
with it could be considered grounds for this Flaw.
That said, a character with this Flaw must indeed be treated poorly; having folks call you out on an unpopular opinion,
or criticize your behavior, is part of the human experience,
whereas having cops shake you down merely for existing is an
actual problem. In order to take this Flaw, your character must
face actual discrimination and attack on a fairly regular and
hazardous basis. No, being called names on the Internet does
not count, although an intense bout of cyberbullying – that
is, doxing, swatting, career destruction, and serious threats to
life and sanity – might count as this Flaw, at the Storyteller’s
discretion.
Because Cultural Other is tied to the character’s social
surroundings, a radical change to those surroundings may
mitigate or eliminate this Flaw. A polyamorous person may beChapter One: Heroic Traits 61
discriminated against in one city, and welcomed with open arms (and
open legs) in another; if that poly character remains in poly-friendly surroundings, then the player needs to buy off or replace this Flaw. Similarly,
your “otherness” must be either something that people know about, or
something that they could find out about easily enough for that element
of your life to become a big problem for you. A deeply hidden “otherness”
is a Dark Secret (see below) until or unless it gets revealed.
To be clear: This Flaw in no way reflects judgment on the part of this
game, its creators, or – one hopes! – your gaming group. It’s intended to
reflect the ways in which mortal (and, often, Awakened) society tends to
treat people who stand out from their cultural norms. Being who they are
and what they do, mages often do stand out in ways that can be hazardous
to their social and sometimes physical health – hello, Burning Times!
However, if this Flaw seems redundant in your group, creates unwanted
real-life tensions between your players, or gets abused by characters (or
players) who are catching hell for acting like dicks, then feel free to ignore
or discard this Flaw.
Dark Secret (1 pt. Flaw)
A skeleton or two is hanging rather precariously in your closet. If (let’s be
honest – when) it slips out and clatters to the floor, your life will get even more
difficult than it already is. Did you steal something precious that was in your
trust? Or live on the streets for a while? Maybe you came from a family you
would rather not discuss (see the Flaw: Family Issues, below), were involved
with a criminal organization, Awakened into a rival faction, or had a child or
lover you’re trying to forget about. In any case, you’ll be in trouble unless
you manage to keep that dark secret hidden… a feat that, in a world where
reading minds is damned near entry-level magick, can be difficult indeed.
(Note: Although this Flaw is traditionally worth only one point,
Dark Secrets with potentially deadly consequences might be worth
more points, at the Storyteller’s discretion.)
Debts (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Mages still need money in order to function in the human realm.
And in your case, you’re kinda fucked financially. Student loans,
credit-card debts, child-support payments, gambling losses, legal
judgments, medical bills, car and /or mortgage payments… the
ways in which a modern mage can get in over her head financially
are as numerous as the parties who prosper from such debts.
And then there’s the possibility of financial manipulation from
Awakened sources – mages or Night-Folk who, intentionally or
otherwise, are keeping you broke in order to assert their hold over
you (see Technocracy: Syndicate, p. 28). Maybe you just suck at the
whole paying-your-bills thing. For whatever reason, your income keeps
going back out. You might indeed have the Background: Resources,
but the money just doesn’t stay in your bank account for long.
As a Flaw, these Debts represent a minimum amount of
money you owe your creditors. The more you owe, the more
this Flaw is worth:
• (1 point) Minimal debt (less than $10,000).
• (2 points) Moderate debt (less than $50,000).
• (3 points) Significant debt (over $50,000).62 The Book of Secrets
• (4 points) Crushing debt (over $100,000).
• (5 points) Overwhelming debt (over $500,000).
From the three-point level onward, your creditors will
expend a fair amount (perhaps a great deal) of effort to collect
those funds from you. Certain creditors, like loan sharks,
will start far lower than that. Tactics could range from roundthe-clock phone calls and red-envelope letters to lawsuits,
repossessions, threats, eviction, and physical violence. For folks
with small and /or irregular incomes, the pressure from debt
and debt-collection harassment can cause intense emotional
and psychological distress… which, in turn, affects one’s ability
to make money… which deepens the debt… which deepens
the stress… in a desperate cycle that can lead to desperate acts.
Discredited (1 pt. Flaw)
In your chosen field, your name is mud. Perhaps you’re
a scientist whose bizarre theories have cost him the respect
of his peers… or an academic who wound up on the wrong
side of departmental politics… or a journalist who stepped
too far over the line of credibility. Whatever it is you did
(or are reputed to have done), your professional associates
look down on you. Add +2 to the difficulty of your social
and Background-based rolls when you’re trying to get those
associates to take you seriously. Although this is a common
Flaw among the feud-happy Etherites, anyone who depends
upon a professional reputation can be discredited in this
fashion – professorial Hermetics, corporate-ladder Syndicate
ops, White Tower agents, and other competitive-field mages
can fall afoul of a bad rep too.
Enemy (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, p. 647.
Esoteric Discourse /
Technobabbler (1 pt. Flaw)
Your obsessive love of a specialized field inspires you to fill
every waking hour with obscure jargon and obtuse metaphraseology. Most folks can’t understand half of what you say, and
their incomprehension of such elementary terminology impels
you to facilitate obligatory (if remedial) pedagogy. Oh, for fuck’s
sake – just talk normal for a change!
In game terms, this Flaw imposes difficulty modifiers (+1
or +2) on social rolls, thanks to the character’s compulsive jargonization, hyperinitiated nomenclature, and condescending
pedanticism. The Flaw’s first variation reflects arcane specialization, the second reflects tech-based terminology, and other
variations (Specious Legalese, Obtuse Academia, and so forth)
could reflect similar fascinations with other fields. For people
who actually understand you, however, the usual penalty might
become a social bonus instead… at which point everyone else
probably leaves the room and lets the experts talk amongst
themselves.
Family Issues (1 to 3 pt. Flaw)
Many mages leave their families behind. You didn’t do
that, although you may often wish you could. A flipside of the
Merit: Family Support (pp. 53-54), this Flaw saddles you with a
basket of goodies from Dysfunction Junction, family-style. You
might have a meddling uncle, an abusive sibling, an alcoholic
parent, or “simply” the leftovers from dealing with such people. You might have tried to escape them, but if so, someone
in your family is still looking for you. (See the Werewolf 20
Flaw: Persistent Parents, and the story “We Are the Shadows
Cast by the Memory of Giants” in Truth Beyond Paradox.)
The family doesn’t have to still be part of your physical reality,
but the mess they left behind if you managed to get away from
them remains a part of your existence today.
As with Supportive Family, the clan in question could be
blood relatives, an adopted family, or a family-of-choice you
kinda wish you hadn’t chosen. The more points you have in
this Flaw, the more your family issues interfere with your Awakened life. They could be mages themselves, though that’s not
often the case. More likely, they’re folks who still look for you
even in your Newlife, hangers-on who won’t leave you alone,
sickly relations who need tending (see also the Flaw: Ward,
p. 66), kids or siblings (or even parents) who have constant
troubles with the law… the possibilities are as endless as the
real-life complications that a troubled family can bring. And
no, you can’t just ditch out on ‘em even if you’ve already tried
to do so. If you could, they wouldn’t still be your problem,
now would they?
Infamy (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
You’ve made a bad name for yourself among the Masses.
Like the Background: Fame, this Flaw represents a degree of
recognition; in your case, though, that’s not a good thing…
especially not when you want to keep your life as a mage a
secret from the Sleepers.
Once again, the weight of the Flaw determines its value:
• (1 point) Certain people within a region or subculture
recognize and dislike you. (Examples: the local drunk,
Vox Day.)
• (2 points) Your notoriety was wide once, but has faded
to occasional recognition and disdain (H.R. Clinton,
M.C. Hammer).
• (3 points) You’re famous, but many people do not like
you (Kanye West, Nickelback).
• (4 points) The authorities don’t like you either (Roosh
V, Jared Fogle).
• (5 points) You’re a household name, and that name is
shit (O.J. Simpson, Charles Manson).
Especially in the age of social media and intelligence networks, this sort of infamy can be a very bad thing. Obviously,Chapter One: Heroic Traits 63
some folks adore you, if only because the rest of the world
hates you. On the whole, however, your reputation among the
Masses is more bad than good, and folks go out of their way
to give you a hard time. As with other bad reputations, you
may not have actually done anything wrong; then again, there
might be reasons that folks hate your guts.
Insane /Infamous Mentor (1 pt. Flaw)
The mage who taught you the ropes is dangerously tangled
up in them. Maybe she’s out of her head (though probably not
a Marauder… yet); or he’s got an awful rep that has splattered
all over you. That person could be angry at you for some reason
(good or otherwise), or live downstream on Shit Creek, with a
nasty habit of dragging you along for the ride. This Flaw makes
an excellent addition to the Background: Mentor, and has a
way of fouling up your relationships with other mages as well
as your bond with the mentor herself.
Mistaken Identity (1 pt. Flaw)
You’re not who folks think you are, but that doesn’t stop
them from thinking that you are that person. For some reason
– similar features, related habits, a bureaucratic fuck-up that
linked their data to you, or maybe some far more insidious
connection – confusion follows you around. This situation
is awkward at best, and can get downright dangerous if that
not-you person is wanted for serious crimes…
Naïve (1 pt. Flaw)
Surely, the world can’t be that dark… can it? (Spoiler:
Yes, yes it can.) Oblivious to the depths of misery around you,
you retain an intrinsic faith in the best possible outcome.
And while this sort of optimism can provide the foundation
for literally world-changing beliefs (see the paradigm It’s All
Good – Have Faith! in Mage 20, p. 570), it can also blind you
to the realities you face. When making a roll that could detect
another character’s bad intentions or malignant nature, add
+2 to the difficulty of your roll. Story-wise, you have a hard
time believing that the terrible things you see around you could
really be as bad as they seem, and may perhaps lack empathy
for other people’s pain (+2 to the difficulty of Empathy-based
rolls, at the Storyteller’s option) because you recognize so little
about pain yourself.
New Kid (1 pt. Flaw)
You’ve just recently Awakened, and you still have something to prove. Your peers don’t think much of you just yet,
and although you’ve got allies who consider you worth their
time, their investment in your goodwill is minimal. Add +2
to the difficulty of your social rolls with more experienced
mages until you’ve earned the right (and the experience) to buy
off this Flaw. On the good side, however, you’re likely to be
popular with certain companions, although – as “new meat”
in a social scene often discovers – that’s not always the kind
of attention you’ll want.
Offline (1 or 3 pt. Flaw)
You hate the goddamned Internet. As far as you’re concerned, it’s a complicated waste of time. You loathe social
networking, lack a webpage, refuse to Twitter, and don’t really
even know (or care) how to Google stuff. Anyone who wants to
contact you can damned well write a letter, use a telephone, or
just leave you the hell alone! (Damn kids, get off my digital lawn…)
While this Flaw is worth only one point in cultures where
the Internet is an occasional (and often privileged) indulgence,
it’s a three-point Flaw in cultures where Internet access and
participation are major elements of most people’s social lives.
Those cultural divides are more tied to generational and economic divides than they are to ethnic or geographical ones.
A poor, elderly, or simply old-fashioned New Yorker might
not really care about net access, so long as she can still stay in
contact with her friends and family; a college student in Rio,
however, would be at a pretty significant disadvantage if he
chose to avoid the Internet. And yeah – twenty-first-century
mages use the Internet too, even if they don’t visit the Digital
Web. Online presence isn’t just for Virtual Adepts anymore!
Rival House (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
You belong to a Chantry (or Construct, or whatever) that
has a longstanding animosity with another such organization.
This could be a rival Hermetic Chantry, a temple whose
members consider you to be heretics, a hostile street gang, an
opposing martial arts order, a coven that has declared a witchwar against your group, a Construct that has marked you all for
death, and so on. This antagonism is mutual, too, and you’re
expected to act accordingly. Mediation remains unlikely, and
things could get worse before they get better… if improved
relations are even possible.
Obviously, such hostility is personal, with deep roots in
the backstory of your chronicle and its characters. Groups of
mages don’t generally pursue mass grudges without serious
reasons to do so! The Flaw’s value depends upon the power
of that other stronghold and the level to which they hate
members of your own.
• (1 point) A minor rivalry with an associated Chantry of
equal or lesser power in relation to your own. For the
most part, the antagonism involves pranks, competition,
minor sabotage, and occasional “friendly” brawls.
• (2points) A significant rivalry (serious fights and slanders,
major sabotage) with a Chantry of similar power, or a
minor rivalry with a Chantry so powerful they don’t
consider yours to be a true threat.
• (3 points) Deadly antagonism between roughly equal
Chantries.
• (4 points) A significant rivalry between your Chantry
and one that’s powerful enough to inflict serious damage
upon your own.64 The Book of Secrets
• (5 points) Deadly hatred from a Chantry that could level
yours if they really wanted to… and they probably do.
From the three-point version onward, it’s pretty unlikely
that the rivalry can be resolved without a shared enemy or
some significant interference from an even more powerful
third party. It might not be resolvable even then. This Flaw
requires the Background: Chantry /Construct, but any
character with such associations can take it – the Flaw is not
restricted to mages from the Traditions and Technocracy.
Your rivalry might cross factions, too; a Hermetic House
might hold a longstanding enmity with a Progenitor lab.
It can also exist within a single group (two rival Etherite
collectives), or between two related groups that do not
belong to the same faction; alchemist sects, for example,
have been arguing over the name Solificati for centuries,
with no end in sight!
Sect Enmity (1 pt. Flaw)
Mage groups tend to have issues with each other by their
very nature. You, however, have managed to piss off an entire
sect of mages within your larger group. You could be a Verbena
witch who hacked off the Hermetic House Flambeau (yipe), a
Black Suit on the wrong side of the Friends of Courage, or a
Red Spear who trash-talked the Ghost Wheel Society and lived
to regret it. Although your enemies won’t try to kill you – you
are theoretically on the same side, after all – they really don’t
like your face, or much else about you.
Generally, the members of the sect in question will have
as little to do with you as they can, and won’t be terribly cooperative if they must deal with you at all. Social dice rolls you
make while dealing with members from this group add +2 to
the difficulty. You cannot, obviously belong to this sect when
you first take this Flaw, although you could conceivably smooth
things over, buy off the Flaw, and join that group later. A player
may buy this Flaw multiple times to reflect poor relationships
with several different sects. Storytellers are advised to create
several reoccurring characters from the rival sect, in order to
give this Flaw some teeth. For a more severe version of this
Flaw, see Hit List, below.
Special Responsibility (1 pt. Flaw)
You and your big mouth! Shortly after you joined your
current group, you stepped up and assumed a duty to that
group. Doing so earned you some points with the leadership,
but that duty comes at great cost to you. This responsibility
weighs on you to a significant degree, consuming time, energy,
and social, emotional and perhaps monetary resources you’d
rather devote to other things.
Obviously, you need to define what you’re doing for whom,
and what you need to do in the course of doing it. Although
it’s (probably) not dangerous in life-threatening ways, this Flaw
demands constant attention. Until you buy off the Flaw, you
really can’t skip out on your responsibilities.
Sympathizer (1 pt. Flaw)
Hey, they’re okay once you get to know them! You’ve expressed
some degree of sympathy for an enemy faction, and that sympathy
does not make you terribly popular! Maybe you’re a Technocrat
who sees validity in the Traditions, a Trad mage who shares
some part of the Technocratic vision, a Disparate mage with
secret ties to one of the other factions, or even – gods help
you! – a mage from pretty much any group, who dares to view
the Mad and Fallen as something other than walking targets
for instant execution. This Flaw goes well with other Flaws
like Rogue, Branded or Fifth Degree, and could well wind
up getting added to your character sheet if you’re not discreet
about your associations with rival mages.
Twisted Apprenticeship (1 pt. Flaw)
Someone taught you all the wrong things. For whatever
reason, the mentor who introduced you to the Awakened realm
did a terrible job, and now you reap the benefits. They may
have told you lies about other groups, filled your head with
nonsense about the nature of magick (though in all honesty,
pretty much everyone does that), or simply behaved like a raging
shmuck and left you with the payoff. Now folks blame you for
things you did not do (or you did out of ignorance), and the
mentor’s bad rep and worse teachings hang about you like a
god-slaying stink. You’ll probably recover eventually, but your
Awakened career got off to a wretched start.
Catspaw (2 pt. Flaw)
You trusted the wrong person, did the wrong thing on
their say-so, and have now become a liability to others and to
yourself. A dupe for someone vastly superior in power, you
need to watch your back now while hoping for an opportunity
to extract yourself from this position. For the moment, you
have to follow orders, and your “cat” needs to keep you safe.
Not long from now, however, one or both of you will change
your priorities, and then things will truly become interesting
for everyone concerned.
Diabolical Mentor (2 pt. Flaw)
Your mentor wasn’t merely bad at his job – he turned
out to be actively malevolent. That person could be an actual
Nephandus, a demented Marauder, a ruthless wizard, a diehard
“black hats and mirrorshades” type of Technocrat, an Infernalist
sellsoul… maybe you don’t even know what your mentor really
is, but it’s just plain bad. Obviously, this personage has fucked
you up. Additionally, if you’ve uncovered things he would rather keep secret, that could lead to other Flaws as well: Enemy,
Cursed, and worse…
Dogmatic (2 pt. Flaw)
Look, it’s great that you’ve got such strong spiritual convictions… but do you have to be such a dick about them? This
Flaw represents a religious, spiritual, and /or philosophical
approach that defines your moral and magickal beliefs. TroubleChapter One: Heroic Traits 65
is, your beliefs don’t play well with others; rules-wise, you add
+2 to the difficulty of all social rolls which involve dealing with
people of differing beliefs. Even when you’re trying, dammit,
to get along with those misguided heretics, folks can tell that
you don’t approve. You sneer, you argue, you try to convert
everyone around you to your way of thinking… you can’t help
it, really – your convictions are just that formidable! After
all, you do use them to change the world, so how could they
possibly be wrong?
Double Agent (2 pt. Flaw)
You work both sides of a very spiky fence; one of these
days, you’re gonna get stuck on it. Perhaps you’re a Syndicate
spy in the Ecstatic Cult, or an Etherite working with Iteration
X. In the days of the Disparate Alliance, you might belong to a
Tradition while ferreting data to your true Craft. Eventually, this
dangerous game will catch up with you. Make plans, establish
contingencies, and try not to get yourself perished!
Obviously, this Flaw must be kept secret from the other
characters in your group. For extra drama, try to keep it hidden
from the other players, too…
Failure (2 pt. Flaw)
Having blown a high-profile job, you’re now considered
a washout by your peers. Until and unless you manage you
redeem yourself, you’re essentially a laughingstock within your
group. Were you a Syndicate tycoon gone bust? A priest caught
doing the nasty with the choir? A cowardly Templar? A Pagan
gone Evangelical (or vice versa)? Life is made of reversals of
fortune, of course. Yeah, you’ll get back on top someday – it’s
just gonna be a hard climb.
Gullible (2 pt. Flaw)
You believe everything folks tell you. You repost memes
without checking their accuracy or source. You fall for cons and
pranksters every single time. Seriously? How can a mage be so
goddamned gullible? Beats me, but yeah – subtract three dice
from every dice pool you roll (down to a minimum of one die)
when you’re trying to penetrate falsehoods (lies, not stealth), or
to fool people with your own bumbling attempts at deception.
Old Flame (2 pt. Flaw)
A former love of your life now works for the enemy. Worse,
she knows your weak spots, and can still call on you “for old
times’ sake.” Unless you manage to succeed in a resisted Manipulation-based social roll contest (see Mage 20, pp. 390-391)
when your old flame tries (again) to win you over (again), you’ll
find yourself doing things (again) against your better judgment
again… and again… and again…
Troublemaker (2 pt. Flaw)
Pretty much the inverse of the Merit: Sanctity (p. 57); you
project an impression of guilt even when you haven’t done
anything wrong. Folks blame you for pretty much everything,
and the authorities go harder on you than they might if you
didn’t seem like such a noxious little turd! You come across
like a natural-born sinner regardless of how you behave. Gee, if
you’re gonna get punished no matter what you do, maybe you
ought to at least have some fun before the whip comes down.
Expendable (3 pt. Flaw)
An upper-level member of your group wants you dead,
and sticks you with missions that will probably get the job
done sooner rather than later. You could be the lab assistant
who keeps being told to send those big metal kites up into the
thunderstorm, the apprentice who keeps getting sent off to
obtain forbidden artifacts, or the Black Suit who keeps facing
off against yet another goddamned werewolf pack while his
dispatcher makes excuses for the lack of timely backup. Either
way, you’re pretty screwed. Worst of all, no one will openly
admit that’s the case, and you may not even know who’s got it
out for you, much less why they’re trying to get you perished.
Although this Flaw works best for Technocratic operatives
(who remain subject to orders no matter who they might be),
it suits any Awakened group that operates with a top-down
hierarchy wherein high-ranking mages assign missions to lower-ranking ones and expect those orders to be obeyed – say, the
Templar Knights, the Order of Hermes, the Celestial Chorus,
and so forth. It does not suit shamans, Ecstatics, or other mages
who don’t give a flying fuck what their so-called superiors say.
(Note: This Flaw resembles the Flaw of the same name in
Vampire: The Masquerade. Mages, however, die much more
easily than vampires do when one of their superiors wants to
get them killed, and so the Flaw is worth considerably more
in Mage than it is in Vampire.)
Narc (3 pt. Flaw)
Cursed with the rep of an informer, you’re on the outs
with your would-be associates. As with other reputation-based
Flaws, this shunning may be based on mistakes and rumors;
in this case, though, it’s probably at least somewhat accurate.
Known spies and spymasters, intelligence officers, witnesses
against their fellow mages, members of groups that are assigned
to investigation and justice (like House Quaesitor or the Ivory
Tower), and other real or assumed snitches generally catch
such reputations by default. System-wise, this Flaw adds +1 to
the difficulty of social rolls when dealing with people who fear
you might be spying on them; story-wise, such people could be
feeding you misinformation, stonewalling you, or plotting to
take you out when the moment to do so seems right.
Notoriety (3 pt. Flaw)
Thanks to this inverse of the Merit:Prestige, you’re saddled
with a bad reputation among your fellow mages. System-wise,
this Flaw adds +2 to the difficulties of all social rolls within
your faction (Traditions, Crafts, Technocracy, etc.), and predisposes pretty much everyone outside your closest friends to
think the worst of you. Rumors dog your steps, and whispers66 The Book of Secrets
precede your appearance. Whether or not the stories are true,
you’ve been linked to some disgrace, and will be shunned and
probably punished accordingly if you haven’t been punished
already. (See the Supernatural Flaw: Branded, p. 89, for a
potential punishment, or for an alternative to this Flaw that
could be taken by a Tradition mage character.) You might be
able to shuck this bad rep eventually, but it’s gonna be a pretty
rough road until you do.
Rivalry (3 to 5 pt. Flaw)
An associate of yours has it out for you, and while this
rival cannot openly move against you (probably because of
an external authority she doesn’t want to risk annoying, or
social pressures that she can’t avoid), she’ll make your life as
difficult as she can under the circumstances. Rumors, sabotage,
exposed scandals, and perennial traps are just a few of your
rival’s weapons against you. And while you can dance around
most of them, a few still manage to hit their mark.
The value of this Flaw depends, as usual, on the amount
of trouble this rivalry causes for you:
• (3 points) Someone of a lower or equal degree of power
and influence wants to complicate your life.
• (4 points) A rival of greater power and influence throws
obstacles in your path whenever possible.
• (5 points) A far more powerful rival is seriously dedicated
to keeping you miserable… possibly even to making you
dead.
Why does this person hate you? It could be a “simply
business” sort of situation, like the rivalry between Syndicate
executives or Hermetic Adepts. There may be a romantic tangle
or family history involved, or perhaps an academic dispute,
as is often found among members of the Etherite Tradition
or Progenitor lab-groups. Chances are, this person doesn’t
actually want you dead – just disgraced or removed from
further consideration. Fatal rivalries do arise, however… and
as Doissetep’s implosion proved long ago, such things can get
really ugly when mages are involved.
Rotten Liar (3 pt. Flaw)
Man, you suck at lying! You could not tell a credible untruth if your life depended on it… which it might, so this can be
sort of a problem for you. It may be that you’re just too honest
for your own good, or cursed to speak the truth as you know
it, regardless of the cost or your intentions; then again, you
might just stammer your way through attempted deceptions,
telegraphing your lies through body language and vocal tone.
Whatever the reason, add +2 to the difficulty of any die roll
you make when you’re trying to deceive another character. Yes,
this penalty extends to magickal deceptions too, like illusions
or mind control. Honesty might not always be the best policy
among the Awakened, but for you it’s generally the best option.
Sleeping with the Enemy (3 pt. Flaw)
A paramour of yours belongs to an enemy group – Awakened
antagonists, perhaps, or maybe one of the Night-Folk (as per the
old Flaw: Massasa Contact). This isn’t simply a matter of rivalry;
if you’re discovered, you’re both probably gonna die. Still, love (or
lust) is a powerful force, and so you and your loved one live out one
of those Romeo and Juliet situations. Just remember, though: Romeo
and Juliet is a tragedy, not a romance, and things are likely to go the
same way for you. (Again, see the entries for both those genres in
Chapter Five’s section regarding Genre, Storytelling, and Mage.)
Ward (3 pt. Flaw)
Mages rarely move through life alone. And when certain
companions – lovers, children, partners, parents, close friends,
even employers – depend upon you, that lack of loneliness can
become a liability. This Flaw represents a character, or a group of
characters, who require constant attention on your part. Your life is
a hazard to them, and their needs often provide hazards for you as
well. Wards tend to get in trouble, require rescuing, and go digging
into aspects of your life you’d prefer they left alone. Is it love that
binds you to your ward? Duty? An oath? Family obligations? A job
like bodyguarding, teaching or medicine? Regardless of the reason,
each ward is an essential part of your life. Their life is your priority.
Although Ward characters may have a useful skill or two,
such folks are unAwakened people, not mages, Night-Folk,
familiars, or other powerful entities. That said, you could take
a Ward Flaw to reflect a special bond with a Retainer, a Cult
member, or one of your Spies. Merits like Supportive Family
or True Love (and Flaws like Family Issues) go well with the
Ward Trait. Wards don’t have to be human, either – your dog,
your cat, your horse… an animal who depends upon you could
be a ward as well. You can take this Flaw more than once, to
reflect several dependent characters. Yeah, there are reasons
that mages tend to avoid having big families!
Obviously, each ward is a Storyteller character, with all the
agendas and complications that situation entails. This person
might not count as aSleeper witnesswith regards to your magick…
but if you’ve been keeping that person in the dark with regards
to your true life and nature, they could still count as a witness
for at least their first experience with your sort of “reality.”
Echo Chamber (4 pt. Flaw)
You surround yourself with groupthink. All opinions
on important topics (politics, religion, magick, and so forth)
must remain unified. No disagreements on such matters are
permitted within this echo chamber, and anyone who bucks
that decree is shown the door – often with great force – and
shunned, probably vilified, afterward. Loyalty to the group is
measured by the devotion each member shares with regards
to the “truth” as your group understands it. As a result, that
“truth” soon gets distorted. Like an echo reverberating within
a closed space, it verges into a distortion of the original source,
growing wilder and more extreme until something has to give.
Will that breaking point be you? Gods forbid…Chapter One: Heroic Traits 67
Essentially a story-based Trait, this Flaw cuts your character off from information that runs contrary to the group’s
determined “truth.” Characters and data that disagree with
that “truth” must be pushed aside, ignored, silenced, possibly
attacked, maybe even destroyed “for the good of the group.”
Because isolation breeds distortion, the Storyteller should
gradually make “the truth” seem more extreme than it once had
been. Anyone – especially a player character – who disagrees
with “the truth” should be punished by the group; the more
extreme the distortions become, the harsher the punishment
becomes as well. Eventually, the distorted “truth” will require
distorted acts as well: assault, torture, murder, terrorism. At
that point, any character who tries to step away will become the
enemy too (possibly receiving the Flaw of that name) – shunned
by former friends at the very least, probably disgraced socially,
and potentially even attacked physically for being a traitor to
the cause.
This Flaw reflects a social phenomenon that’s increasingly
common in the twenty-first century, though it’s certainly not
exclusive to our era: a social group committed to enforced
orthodoxy and the removal of dissent. The group in question
could be a religious or military order, a socio-political activist
tribe, a corporate office, a think-tank, an art collective, a fannish subculture, a media outlet, mystic sect, or Political Action
Committee – any social clique that holds “certain truths to be
self-evident” and vital to that group’s existence could become
an echo chamber. “Us” and “them” is a ruling principle, and
if you’re not one of Us, then you’re one of Them.
Hit List (4 pt. Flaw)
A rival group wants you dead. You might be a Templar
who’s made enemies among the Etherites, an Etherite who
crossed the line with the New World Order, and so forth.
Whatever happened, it’s personal and extends to the entire
group. As with the Vampire 20 Flaw: Clan Enmity, this is a
deadly business, far worse than the one-point Sect Enmity,
above. Social rolls when dealing with members of this group
add +2 to their difficulty – if you get a chance to make such
rolls at all. Whether or not the enemy group actively attacks
you on sight, its members will go out of their way to make your
life solitary, unpleasant, nasty, brutish, and short.
Mr. Red Tape (4 pt. Flaw)
Bureaucracy hates you. Any official complication that could
go wrong will go wrong if you’re the one who’s dealing with the
authorities. Essentially the opposite of the Merit: Master of Red
Tape (p. 58), this Flaw adds + 2 to the difficulty of any roll you
make when trying to get something done through an established
system, and throws stupid mistakes and delays into the works
whenever you’ve got to work with any sort of bureaucracy.68 The Book of Secrets
Overextended (4 pt. Flaw)
You’ve tried to do too much, and the strain has begun to
show. Even when you add Time Sphere magick to the equation,
there really are only so many hours in a day, and you spend most
of them just trying to keep up with various commitments. You’re
on too many committees, stuck with too many reports, nurturing
too many connections, maintaining too many resources for one
person – even a mage – to handle. Other characters, on top of
it all, have begun to undermine your ability to juggle all those
plates, and folks are gunning for your position if and when you
finally fuck up badly. While this Flaw best suits members of the
Technocratic Union, it’s appropriate for any mage who belongs
to a group that prizes involvement, most especially the Hermetic
Order, Celestial Chorus, Wu Lung, and Templar Knights.
Probationary Member (4 pt. Flaw)
Having recently defected from a rival group or faction,
you’re on probation with the current group. Peers expect you
to turn on them, and certain folks have probably decided to
throw you under the bus on general principle. Your continued
membership (possibly even your survival) depends upon doing
everything right and nothing wrong… and just how often do
things really go that well in the real world, anyway?
Rogue (4 pt. Flaw)
The loosest of cannons, you’re gonna do whatever you
damn well please, and to hell with any and all consequences!
You might still belong to a group, but your membership is more
a matter of habit or convenience than of loyalty. Alternately,
you may have gone your way and now exist in a nebulous state
between fondly remembered comrade and total outlaw. Certain
Backgrounds (Requisitions and Secret Weapon) are forbidden
to you now, and others (Allies, Backup, Chantry, Resources,
and potentially many more) are hard to access – perhaps even
impossible to access – if their connection to you depends upon
your allegiance to a group. Former peers consider you a liability,
and the main reason no one has taken you out yet is because
nobody’s gotten around to doing so successfully.
For Technocratic operatives, this Flaw is a slow-motion
death sentence; for other mages, it could involve similar threats
to longevity, although many Crafts (aside from the Templars,
Wu Lung, and Hippolytoi) and most Traditions (aside from
the Chakravanti, Akashayana, and Order of Hermes) take a
more liberal approach to rogue members. Either way, your
relationships with former allies are strained at best (+3 to the
difficulty of most social rolls involving their goodwill), and
you’re on rather hostile terms with your so-called (or former)
superiors. Some mages manage to live for quite a while in this
state of mutual antagonism. Most, however, do not.
Witch-Hunted (4 pt. Flaw)
The Masses want you dead. You’ve been exposed for what
you are and can do, and so various unAwakened parties have
decided to take you out like the abomination you’ve become.
These hunters could be law-enforcement authorities, religious
groups, fanatical sects, furious mobs, imbued hunters, pawns
of the Night-Folk… whoever they might be, these people offer a
significant threat to your existence, possessing the power to end
you and the dedication to back it up. Your Arts alone cannot
stop them, and a painful showdown (or three) is sadly inevitable.
Fifth Degree (5 pt. Flaw)
Whether you know it or not, you have outlived your usefulness to the Technocratic Union. Your superiors have set you
up to fall, and your date with Room 101 or a suicide mission
waits right around the corner. Combine all the deficits of the
Flaw: Rogue (above) with the assurance that you’re only alive
because someone would rather have you take out the bad guys
when you go down in a blaze of glory than spend the resources
necessary to take you down themselves. You have one more
chance to make good and stay alive. Step out of line again, and
your fate will be the sort of thing that makes cyborgs cringe.
Supernatural Merits
Nothing’s really “supernatural” to a mage. Still, some
Merits and Flaws defy the easy categories that Sleepers impose
upon their world. A more appropriate name, perhaps, would
be Metaphysical Merits: benefits of the unseen world that work
in ways the mundane world rarely understands.
Given the powerful nature of such Merits and Flaws, the
Storyteller may disallow certain Traits from the following section.
Several previously published Supernatural Merits and Flaws have
been revised from their original appearance, or else omitted
entirely, because their initial extravagance runs at odds with the
Mage 20 rules and atmosphere. Players could, with Storyteller
approval, still employ those Traits, but we advise against it. A
handful of those Traits, however – notably Claws /Fangs /Horns
/Hooves /Barbed Tail, Immunity, and Resistant Pattern – can
be found in the Mage 20 sourcebook Gods, Monsters & Familiar Strangers, as they represent abilities that are more suited to
non-human entities than to all-too-human mages.
Burning Aura (1 pt. Merit)
To those who can sense it, your aura burns with amazing
brilliance and clarity. Even folks who can’t actually perceive
this bright corona of energy realize that you’re “different.”
Entities that can read your aura react accordingly; some will
treat you with uncommon respect, while others will view you
as a nice meal. The nature of your aura cannot be hidden
easily (+2 to the difficulty of any attempt to do so), and while
this is a dreadful disadvantage for, say, a Nephandus, people
who prize forthright integrity may reduce their difficulties by
-2 when they’re trying to make an impression that’s in accord
with that vivid aura and affecting characters who can sense it.
Assuming that you employ these optional Traits, your
Resonance and Synergy each get a vivid, one-dot boost from
this Merit – see Chapter Three, pp. 133-134, for details. For
aura colors and tones, see Mage 20, p. 507.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 69
Green Thumb (1 pt. Merit)
Plants flourish from your touch. Although they don’t
bloom and grow on contact (a wildly paranormal effect which
was part of this Merit’s original form), they do attain a healthy
boost when you work with them. Reduce the difficulty of all
non-Arete rolls by -2, and reduce the difficulty of Arete rolls by
-1, when you work with plants, trees, and other forms of vegetation –algae, mold, fungus, seaweed, and the like. Story-wise,
your aura pulsates with green vitality, plant matter grows fast
and robust in your presence, and your Resonance and Synergy
reflect a powerful connection to the green world. A common
Merit among Verbena, Bata’a, and other primal mystics, this
could also represent a strange acumen for vegetative biomass
that certain technomancers enjoy.
Bardic Gift (2 pt. Merit)
Blessed with uncanny inspiration, you create profoundly
evocative artwork. Truth echoes through your words, blazes
from your canvas, resonates in song, speaks silently in dance.
Although artistic skill is, of course, important, this gift runs
deeper than mere technique. Art is your passion, your spirit,
your Truth. And that Truth manifests itself in whatever arts
you pursue, up to and including the Magickal Arts.
When making a roll with the Art Talent, reduce the difficulty
by -2. Even when the attempt itself falls short of your expectations
(that is, when you fail a roll), your creations feature an unmistakable gleam of brilliance and a preternatural expression of Truth.
Although you’re not required (as a player) to employ artwork as
part of your magickal focus, chances are good that your approach
to magick does feature elements of painting, dance, music, and
other manifestations of artistic expression.
Circumspect Avatar (2 pt. Merit)
You’ve never seen your Avatar, and probably doubt that
such a thing exists. Sure, you have a shadow, and a reflection,
or maybe a little dog who’s followed you around since you were
a kid and seems no older even though he should have died of
old age years ago, but an Avatar? Nah – that’s a buncha New
Age hippie crap! You have yet to encounter any such thing, you
don’t go on “seekings” or whatever they’re called, and you get
your metaphysical insights the same way any normal person
does: through everyday events in the everyday world.
Essentially, this Merit grants a “silent” Avatar – one that,
for whatever reason, does not hound or guide your character
but merely drops hints, cues, and clues that the mage either
figures out or doesn’t figure out on her own. Seekings and
Epiphanies take place in the physical realm, typically as puzzles
and dilemmas that happen to be related to issues that the mage
needs to sort through in order to advance to the next level of
understanding. During such situations, the Avatar may indeed
appear (possibly even manifest – see the Merit:Manifest Avatar,
p. 71), but only as some apparently mundane person, creature
or thing, not as an obviously paranormal entity. You could,
for instance, get a call from your mother that sends you into
an introspective mood which, in turn, leads you to figure out
an important riddle from your past; Mom, of course, denies
even having called you. Huh. So who could that call have been
from, anyway? Or did you, perhaps, just imagine it after all?
Faerie Affinity (2 pt. Merit)
Fae beings like you. Drawn by an ineffable appeal, they
seek you out and share secrets with you that few mortals even
comprehend. System-wise, you lower the difficulty of your social
rolls by -2 when you’re dealing with changelings and related
entities; in return, changelings reduce their difficulty by -2
when they attempt – through whatever method – to obtain
Glamour from you, or to enchant you so as to bring you into
their ephemeral realm. Story-wise, the Fae tend to favor you
over other mortals, even when your temperaments would seem
to be at odds with one another. A gruff Nocker, for example,
normally has no use for frivolity… but in your case, you silly
Cultist, he’ll make this one exception!
Technomancers, being considered “banal” in the eyes of
the Fae, may not purchase this Merit. Even if they don’t belong to the Technocratic Union, the presence of such mages is
metaphysical poison to the Dreaming Ones. (See Changeling:
The Dreaming for details about the effects of Glamour and
Banality on changelings.)
Medium (2 pt. Merit)
You possess an unnerving affinity for the Restless Dead…
or perhaps it’s that they possess an unnerving affinity for you.
Although you cannot actually see ghosts unless you have at least
one dot in the Spirit Sphere, those ghosts can talk to you, and
you can talk to them. A successful Perception + Awareness roll
allows you to sense their presence even if you can’t see or hear
them nearby, and your aura shines faintly like a spirit-beacon
in the Shadowlands. As a result, the dead tend to favor you
(unless they’re trying to kill you), and can become quite chatty
if they have something to say. Given how deeply mages prize
information, such chattiness can be rather helpful and occasionally life-changing.
Because “chatty” can quickly become “obnoxious,” this
Merit is a double-sided blade. You reduce the difficulty of your
social rolls by -2 when dealing with ghosts, and may perceive
things that the living normally cannot understand. The things
you perceive, though, aren’t always pleasant, and – seeing as
how ghosts tend to stick around because they have unfinished
business to attend to – the dead can get downright annoying
with their requests.
For details about the Restless Dead, see Wraith: The
Oblivion. For system details about Sphere-based necromancy,
see the section of that name in the M20 sourcebook How Do
You DO That?, pp. 84-89.
Unaging (2 pt. Merit)
The years seem to pass you by. Time moves on, but you
remain essentially the same physical age as you were when this70 The Book of Secrets
Merit stopped your aging process. Maybe you discovered the
Fountain of Youth, upgraded yourself to perpetual stability,
assumed an odd relationship with the time stream, or entered
an uncanny bargain that preserved your current age. And so,
although you continue to accumulate the scars, experience,
and perspective of age, your body maintains a consistent state
of chronological development. Note that this is not the same
thing as immortality – injuries and sickness can kill you just as
surely as they’ll kill any other person. Age-based decrepitude,
however, is not something you’ll have to worry about.
Celestial Affinity (3 pt. Merit)
You get along especially well with a certain type of spirit
entity. Depending upon your practice, you might relate well
with nature spirits, High Umbral Courtiers, Digital Web entities, the Restless Dead, the Loa, angelic or demonic beings,
and so forth.
When you’re dealing with entities within a single selected
category, you reduce the difficulty of your summoning and
negotiation rolls by -2. (See the section that deals with Summoning, Binding, Bargaining, and Warding in How Do You
DO That?, pp. 90-95.) This bonus does not apply to attempts to
bind or ward against such beings, as it’s based upon goodwill, not
force. It does, however, apply to the Arete rolls when casting
the summoning Effect (within the normal modifier limits, as
usual), because the entities in question are more inclined to
show up when you call upon them.
For three additional points per category, you may add another
category of spirits, assuming that your practice favors an affinity for
such spirits. (A BCD Void Engineer “ghost-buster,” for example,
could not purchase an Affinity for ghosts, though a necromancer
could certainly do so.) If you abuse this goodwill, as one might
imagine, this bonus, and the Merit, both go away – and might
wind up being replaced by a Flaw like Immortal Enemy (p. 93)
if your mage behaves in an especially foolish manner.
Cloak of the Seasons (3 pt. Merit)
Adverse weather does not bother you. Regardless of your
clothing or lack thereof, you’re essentially immune to the effects
of exposure to harsh climates, as described in Mage 20, p. 435.
You still need to eat, drink, and breathe – this Merit won’t save
you from starvation or suffocation – and climate-based obstacles (fog, high winds, snowdrifts, ice, etc.) hinder you as badly
as they’ll hinder anybody else. Aside from outright attacks by
the elements, however, you remain untouched by extremes of
temperature and climate. You might not always be comfortable,
but you’ll survive.
Cyclic Magick (3 pt. Merit /Flaw)
The strength or weakness of your Arts is tied to some periodic
cycle – the phases of the moon, night or day, your menstrual
periods, the rise and fall of the stock market, and so forth. At
the peak of your cycle, your magick flows most easily; at its nadir,
you find it challenging to work with your magick at all.
System-wise, this Trait is both a Merit and a Flaw, granting
bonuses at one point in the cycle and penalties on its opposite
point. At the highest point, you reduce your casting difficulties
by -3 for one hour, while at the lowest point you increase them
by +3 for one hour. On either end of that cycle, you subtract
or add -1 /+1 to your casting difficulties for each hour on both
sides – the surge and the ebb – of that cycle: -2 or + 2 for the two
hours on each side of the peak or nadir, -1 or +1 on the two hours
on the side of those two hours, and no modifiers during the rest
of the time in between. If, for example, Victoria Ashley-Croft
bani Flambeau has a peak at midnight and a low at noon, her
player would receive a peak modifier of -3 difficulty at midnight,
-2 difficulty at 11:00 PM and 1:00 AM, a -1 difficulty at 10:00
PM and 2:00 AM, and no modifiers otherwise, aside from the
reverse modifiers (+3 at noon, +2 at 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM, and
+1 at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM) at the opposite end of that cycle.
Naturally, you’ll need to decide just what this cycle is when
you select this Trait, and then determine what the highest and
lowest points of that cycle would be. This Merit must also be
tied into your focus – intrinsically connected to the beliefs you
hold and the practices you follow. Your choice of instruments is
often tied to such cycles too; cycle-bound instruments include
celestial alignments, crossroads and crossing-days, formulae
and mathematics, group rites, money and wealth, music (peaks
and lulls in a song, movements in a symphony, etc.), numbers
and numerology, and offerings and sacrifices (“when the stars are
right”). A stockbroker will be watching the peaks and ebbs on Wall
Street, while a witch pays attention to the cycles of the moon or
her blood. By observing your cycles, you’ll have a good idea about
the best and worst times to use your Arts. And by observing you,
your allies and enemies may be able to figure those things out too.
Danger Sense (3 pt. Merit)
A heightened state of awareness allows you to sense impending harm. This gift could originate from primal perceptiveness,
intense conditioning, spirit voices that warn you of danger,
nanotech sensors, or other methods of refined cognizance.
Whatever the source of this Merit might be, your Storyteller
must make a secret Perception + Alertness roll for you when
some otherwise hidden threat is heading toward your character.
The difficulty for this roll depends upon the immediacy
of the danger; a distant, abstract sort of danger (like a plot to
kill you) is far harder to sense than an onrushing disaster (like
a sniper’s bullet), and would thus have a higher difficulty (say,
difficulty 10 for the plot, difficulty 6 for the bullet). A simple
success would tell you that something’s wrong, while a large
number of successes could pinpoint the nature and location
of the threat.
Your Storyteller, of course, is under no obligation to give
you objective details about that threat. She could be as vague
as “A chill tightens across your scalp,” with perhaps a hint of the
direction and nature of the danger’s source (“A sudden metallic
clicking sound echoes in from behind your right side. What do you do?”).Chapter One: Heroic Traits 71
Hands of Daedalus (3 pt. Merit)
You’ve got an innate gift for crafting machines and technology. Such devices seem to come to life in your hands, fitting
easily into place and functioning with incredible precision once
you’ve worked with ‘em. Although this gift does not extend
to the ins and outs of software technology, you can work on
computer hardware (assuming that you know what you’re doing)
as naturally as you can tune a ’58 Ford.
From a systems standpoint, any rolls you make to craft, repair,
invent, or otherwise modify mechanical technologies are at -2
difficulty when you’ve got the opportunity to put those Hands
of Daedalus to work. Tech-based magickal instruments (see the
Mage 20 entries for Armor, Devices and Machines, and other
hardware-based technologies) and practices (see Craftwork and
Hypertech in the Focus and the Arts section of Mage 20, Chapter Ten) function, in your hands, as Personalized Instruments
(Mage 20, pp. 503 and 587-588) once you’ve had a chance to
get familiar with them… and to have them get familiar with you.
Lucky (3 pt. Merit)
Lady Fortune has a thing for you. As a result, you may
re-roll a failed die roll (botches included) up to three times per
story (not per session). Each do-over may be rerolled only once,
so don’t push your luck too far.
Manifest Avatar (3 pt. Merit)
For most mages, the Avatar remains a mysterious figure,
goading them from the sidelines and appearing primarily
within a Seeking or during other moments of intense stress.
For you, however, the Avatar is a vibrant presence in your
life, as real to you as anyone else. Essentially a character in
its own right, this manifested Avatar interacts with you on
an almost daily basis. In certain situations, it might interact
with other people, as manifestly real as any other person in
your world.
The Manifest Avatar Merit embodies the Avatar as a full
character under the Storyteller’s control. On its own, this
Merit reflects that Avatar as a person who only the associated
mage can see, hear, and interact with on a physical level; in
conjunction with the Background: Allies, however, the Avatar
becomes a character that everyone can see, hear, and feel. In
both cases, the Avatar may come and go as it pleases, bound
only by the physical laws with which it chooses to be bound.
The physical Avatar’s shell can be injured or killed, but that
in itself does not kill the Avatar – merely its body. For obvious
reasons, that solid Avatar should have a guise that won’t be
too vulgar or bizarre for the Consensus to endure – a cloaked,
whispering figure, perhaps, but not a screeching, tentacled
monstrosity. The manifested Avatar’s Traits depend upon the
value of the Allies Background, as well as the physical form of
that incarnation. An equine or lupine Avatar, for instance, will
have different Traits than an Avatar that manifests as a crow,
shadow, mirror, or child.
Your Avatar does not hang a sign around her neck that
proclaims Avatar. In the first edition Cult of Ecstasy Tradition
Book, for example, Cassie deals with a manifested Avatar named
Aria who never reveals herself to be anything other than a wild
child who looks disturbingly like an alternate-reality version of
Cassie and knows things no one else should know about Cassie’s
past, present, future, and inner self. (For details, see that book,
pp. 5-45.) Unless either the mage or the Avatar announces its
true identity, other characters don’t usually think that your
manifested Avatar is anything other than what it appears to be.
Mages or Night-Folk who can see auras or souls might catch
on, but most other folks remain clueless.
An Avatar manifesting only for the mage can affect the
material world only when no other characters or devices can
see that entity, although it might appear to others as an online
presence, a ghostly figure, as odd sounds, or through other phenomena. An Allies-based Avatar remains as solid as it wants to
be, lacking the powers of a human mage but possessed (literally)
of the power to fade in and blink out as it desires. Again, the
Manifested Avatar is a Storyteller character, with agendas and
behavioral quirks that confound both the mage and his player.
Although that Avatar has its mage’s best interests at heart, it
might play the role of a rival, lover, best friend, or nemesis…
quite possibly all of them at once.
Mark of Favor (3 pt. Merit)
A godlike entity has claimed you as its own, and has
stamped your features with evidence of that claim. You might
have the bushy red hair and sly eyes of Reynard the Fox, the
hearty temper and brawny build of Thor, the compassionate
fury of the Christ in your eyes, or Legba’s lame leg and penchant
for corncob pipes and tobacco. Folks who understand the lore
of your associated god-form recognize this Mark of Favor, and
even those who don’t know who you’re marked by realize that
there’s something special about you.
An excellent companion to the Background: Legend,
and already an element of the Background: Totem (see Totem
Mark in Mage 20, p. 327), this Trait provides a recognizable
connection to a renowned god-form. Whether or not this
actually is a sign of divine favor, of course, depends upon your
Storyteller’s preferred theological metaphysics. As far as your
character is concerned, it totally is. Note that such favor isn’t
always a happy thing; mythology is full of people who shared
dysfunctional relationships with divine parents and patrons!
When dealing with people who recognize the Mark and
respect the deity that bestowed it, you subtract -2 from the difficulty of related social rolls. Opponents of your divine patron
consider you an enemy, and although intimidation-style rolls still
receive the -2 reduction in difficulty, rolls that attempt to get on
the good side of such people add +2 to the difficulty instead.
A Mark of Favor may, at the Storyteller’s discretion, bestow
other miraculous talents, too. Strange things happen, and those
things remain beyond the Marked character’s control. Someone
chosen by the Virgin Mary could possess a minor healing touch,72 The Book of Secrets
while the chosen of Thor has a literally shocking touch
when he gets mad. Again, these powers exist completely at the
Storyteller’s whim, and suit the flavor of the story, not the
desires of the player. Essentially, they’re miracles granted by
your god, both given and taken in mysterious ways.
Natural Channel (3 pt. Merit)
You’ve got an innate affinity with the Otherworlds.
Sliding through from the mortal realm to the Three Worlds is
easier for you than it is for other Awakened folk. System-wise,
you subtract -2 from the difficulty of your rolls to penetrate
the Gauntlet. Story-wise, crossing over feels, to you, like a
primal sort of homecoming, as if you exist between worlds
on an elemental level.
Natural Shapeshifter (3 pt. Merit)
Guided by an innate affinity for metamorphosis, you
can change your shape more easily than most mages do.
Such changes still demand the usual Life Sphere Ranks and
Effects, but your difficulty for such rolls is reduced by -2
(the usual limits apply), and you don’t need to worry about
losing yourself in the new form, as described in How Do
You DO That?, p. 20. Such talents don’t necessarily link
you to the Night-Folk, although this Merit fits in well with
Fae Blood or Shapechanger Kin (and the Mental Flaw:
Feral Mind, as well; see p. 52). The gift does not, however,
affect your ability to change other people’s shapes in any
way. Such talent works for you alone.
For a potentially related paradigm and practice, see
the Chapter Three entries We are Meant to be Wild
(p. 93) and Animalism ( pp. 197-199).
Oracular Ability (3 pt. Merit)
Everything, to you, has a richer significance than it might
otherwise appear. The flight of birds, the fall of cards, the
patterns of sand after a wave, a spatter of sacrificial blood…
in your eyes, they’re all clues to the Universal Mystery.
You’re good at deciphering such clues, and so while many
enigmas remain unanswered, you often spot insights that
other people – even mages – fail to see.
In game terms, you can make a Perception + Awareness
roll (difficulty 7) whenever the Storyteller feels you’re in
a position to perceive a hidden message in apparently
random phenomena. If you do spot what appears to be
a message, you can make a second roll of Perception +
Esoterica (or Occult, whichever is higher) to see if you
can interpret the message you think you see. The difficulty of this interpretation roll depends on how random
the phenomena is; a deck of cards, for instance, is less
random (difficulty 6 or 7) than a scatter of crow feathers
(difficulty 8 or 9), and so is better suited for divination
purposes. This doesn’t mean you can’t read that scatter
of feathers, only that doing so is more challenging than
interpreting a deck of cards!Chapter One: Heroic Traits 73
A successful interpretation roll wins a vague yet potentially
valuable answer from the Storyteller – couched, of course, in
symbolic metaphors and wide-open meanings. (Storytellers, see
The Deeper Level in Mage 20, pp. 363-366, and Prophecy
and Hindsight in How Do You DO That?, pp. 55-56, for
guidance.) Such answers are not at all reliable, naturally, but
they stand a decent chance of being accurate enough to help
you read patterns in apparently random chance.
Parlor Trick (3 pt. Merit)
You’ve honed a special trick – a simple, specific, non-combat application of your Arts – which you can perform without
making a casting roll. Such tricks include things like conjuring
a business card, stirring a pot without touching the spoon (or
the pot), igniting your cigarette without lighters or a match,
producing a small amount of light without mechanical contrivance, changing your hair color with a shake of your head, and
so on. To a Sleeper, these tricks look like something a normal
person could do with a mysterious bit of skill. You, of course,
realize that the skill in question is not quite what they think it is.
Three important rules govern this Merit:
• It cannot be a feat with direct damage-producing combat
applications (though a “light your cigarette” trick could
also work with a stream of flowing gasoline). No popping
claws or conjuring firearms!
• It must be a quick, simple action that a Sleeper witness
could explain away as practiced sleight of hand.
• These tricks are limited to things you could do with
Sphere Ranks 1 to 3, apply to only one specific trick (conjuring a rose, say, not conjuring anything that’s roughly
rose-sized), and you must have the Spheres necessary to
perform the feat in the first place. This Merit does not
allow you to cast Effects above your normal abilities!
Each trick costs three points, and must suit your character’s
metaphysical focus. You can take this Merit up to three times,
total. Obviously vulgar feats (making yourself disappear in broad
daylight) are prohibited, although a clever use of circumstances
(the old Batman disappearance trick – see How Do You DO
That?, p. 77) could be included in your bag of tricks.
This Merit is intended to give your character and chronicle
a little extra flair. It should not be allowed as an end-around to
skirt the rules, or as a secret weapon that he can use without
consequences like Paradox. Under unfamiliar and /or hostile
circumstances, like stirring someone else’s pot in someone else’s
kitchen, this Parlor Trick might not work at all.
Spirit Magnet (3 to 7 pt. Merit or Flaw)
Ephemeral entities flock to your presence. The essence of
who you are – benign or malignant – draws spirits to you, and
they, in turn, affect the essence of who you are. For the most
part, these entities cluster around you in the Penumbra, invisible
to mortal perceptions; whenever you cross the Gauntlet, though
(either with your perceptions or with your body), they’re waiting
for you there. Spirits that can manifest physical forms may come
across the Gauntlet to visit you, and those that cannot take on
physical bodies still energize the spiritual atmosphere in your
vicinity. Whether or not this is a good thing for you depends
upon whether you select this Trait as a Merit or a Flaw:
• The Merit form of Spirit Magnet draws generally benevolent spirits – Naturae, Lunes, totem and animal entities
of the gentler variety, and so on. These spirits protect
you from malignant entities, warn you of impending
danger, offer advice, help you out when you visit the
Otherworlds, and generally make your life easier. Folks
who can sense those spirits (mediums, shamans, medicine-folk, werecreatures, etc.) tend to favor you; after
all, if the better sorts of spirits like you, then you must
be someone worth knowing.
• The Flaw version represents the presence of malevolent spirits – Banes, demons, and other nasty Umbral
beasts. Summoned by curses or spiritual corruption,
these entities seek to tempt you, poison you, feed
off your vitality, and otherwise turn your life into a
self-contained Hell On Wheels. Spirit-sensitive folk
will avoid you unless they’re into that sort of thing,
and werewolves will consider you to be “of the Wyrm”
(whatever the hell that means), if only because of the
company you keep. Although you might not consider
yourself a bad person at heart, your spiritual companions say otherwise!
The value of this Merit of Flaw is, as always, based on how
helpful or troublesome the spirits can be, how powerful they are,
and how many of them you have to deal with when they appear.
• (3 points) Minor entities occasionally offer aid or
hindrance.
• (4 points) Minor entities show up frequently, or in small
numbers.
• (5 points) Minor entities surround you often, whether
you want them to or not, and more potent ones have
taken interest in your existence.
• (6 points) You have the interest of one or two entities
of significance, and plenty of minor ones pay great
attention to you.
• (7 points) You’re never alone, even when you probably
wish you could be.
This spiritual companionship could be directly opposed
to your true nature. A really awful person might attract benevolent entities who want to save her, while a veritable St.
Anthony could be plagued with demons intent on fucking up
his soul. Even so, such constant presence does have an effect
on your overall health. Mind, body, and spirit are interwoven74 The Book of Secrets
whether we want to recognize that or not, and a mortal who
attracts Otherworldly entities has got something unusual going
on under the skin.
Spirit Mentor (3 pt. Merit)
A ghost, Loa, or other ephemeral entity has taken a special
interest in you. As an expression of favor, this entity teaches you
things few mortals ever have the opportunity to learn. Although those
lessons do not include Sphere-based magick, you could learn insights
that help you to expand your knowledge and better understand the
nature of Reality. (See Raising or Learning Spheres in Mage 20,
p. 337.) More often, though, this entity tells you secrets, offers you
enigmas, and helps you work through situations that would leave
most mortals scratching their heads or crying in corners.
Your Spirit Mentor could also teach you new Abilities, or
help you improve the ones you have, if such teaching seems
appropriate to the spirit in question. A data-entity might be
able to teach you about computers, while an incarnation of
Zhengyi Zhenren’s tiger could teach you tiger-form kung fu.
Such teaching tends to take place in the Otherworlds, or in
dreams, rather than in the material realm, although a spirit who
can Materialize (as the Charm of that name) could certainly
teach a person in her own home realm.
As with other character-related Traits, your mentor is a
Storyteller character with its own agendas, personality, and
so on. This Merit could be combined with the Backgrounds:
Ally, Familiar, Mentor, or Totem to represent a spirit who
plays several roles in your life. Depending on how active your
ephemeral friend is in your everyday life, other folks might
know about this mentor, consider it to be “part of the family,”
or think you’re utterly out of your mind… and if that spirit
clashes with the company you keep (like a Loa hanging with a
Technocrat, or a demon with a Chorister), your friend might
get you into hot water on the human side of your life!
Supernatural Companion (3 pt. Merit)
You’ve got a friend among the Night-Folk: a vampire, a
changeling, a werebeast, a ghost, or some other entity who exists
outside the Sleeping Masses. This friend isn’t quite as reliable
as an Ally Background character, but can aid you if need be.
That door swings both ways, of course; your companion will
also call on you from time to time, and not always on the most
convenient occasions!
Folks (and Night-Folks) probably frown upon this friendship. Werewolves, for example, aren’t fond of you Caern-robbing
mage-types! That’s especially true if you’re a Technocrat who’s
buddy-buddy with one of those damned Reality Deviants, or
a Tradition mage who pals around with a bloodsucking fiend.
Yeah, this friendship is worth the trouble, but it can really be
a hassle at times. Whoever and whatever this friend might be,
the Storyteller creates and controls the character in question…
with all the strange priorities, conflicting needs, and secret
agendas that situation suggests.
Stormwarden /Quantum Voyager
(3 or 5 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 643.
Deathwalker (4 pt. Merit)
The Underworld welcomes you. While most Umbral
travelers are more or less barred from the Shadowlands and
Low Umbra unless they possess special magicks (or have died),
you can step sideways into the Dead Lands with a simple application of Spirit 3. When you do so, your aura assumes the
pale tone of death, and you become essentially indistinguishable from a ghost unless some knowledgeable entity makes a
successful Perception + Occult roll (difficulty 7) to see you for
what you really are. If the Avatar Storm is still raging in your
chronicle, you can pass into the Low Umbra without suffering
the Storm’s effects.
This sort of “gift” often leaves macabre traces on the mortals
it favors. Hence, this Merit is well-suited for the Flaws: Echoes,
Uncanny, and Primal Marks. Thanks to their innate ties to
the Dead Lands, Deathwalkers, as a rule, view the Otherworlds
through the Vidare Mortem, suffer from Morbidity Quiets,
and tend to have a rather fatalistic view of life.
Fae Blood (4 pt. Merit)
Your veins pulse with the enigmatic blood of the fae.
Although not a full changeling, you possess a distant tie to the
Dreaming by way of your strange heritage. In Changeling: The
Dreaming terms, you’re kinain: a mortal human related to their
kind. Your Banality rating is low (no higher than 4, and often
lower than that), and you remain permanently enchanted in
the sense that you perceive, and are affected by, the changeling
world. As a default member of that eldritch fellowship, you
also tend to get swept up in their odd intrigues, and know an
uncomfortable amount about their hidden world.
As with the Merit: Faerie Affinity, this Merit is forbidden
to technomancers of all kinds. Their Banality is too high to
sustain this gift of the blood.
Shapechanger Kin (4 pt. Merit)
Through a distant but noticeable quirk of lineage, you
share a touch of the Changing Blood. In plain English, you’re
related to one of the were-breeds: werewolves, werecats, werecrows, and so forth. This gift does not grant you their powers
or Gnosis, but you probably know a few secrets (in game terms,
Lore Knowledge) about your kin. You remain immune to the
primal-fear Delirium that affects most people in a werecreature’s
presence (not that mages suffer from it anyway); can travel in
the Otherworlds longer than most mortals manage, without
suffering theDisconnectionand Acclimation side-effects of such
travel (detailed in Mage 20, pp. 482-483); and possibly enjoy
some goodwill from your feral family, so long as you haven’t
done anything to piss them off. Their enemies, however, are
yourenemies, which makes this anextremelydouble-edged Merit.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 75
Twin Souls (4 pt. Merit)
To you, the term soulmate is literally true. Your Avatar has a
twin that has been embodied within another mortal body. That
other person (typically a human being, but potentially an animal)
shares your Nature and Essence, and possibly your Demeanor as
well. Even so, your “twin” can be a very different person – different
gender, different ethnicity, different culture, and again possibly
even a “higher” animal like a wolf, bear, hawk, bison, and so
forth. That person might live on the other side of the world, and
may not even know that you exist. If soul-twins meet in person,
though, both feel an unmistakable connection to one another. This
connection, however, might not necessarily translate to goodwill.
Blood-siblings often clash, and soulmates can clash as well.
If that twin is also a mage (many twin Avatars are not yet
Awakened), then both mages have the same Avatar rating. You
can both share Quintessence and cast spells together if you
happen to be physically touching (or, in the Umbra, ephemerally
touching). In this case, the character with the highest Arete
rating and Sphere Ranks is the one whose Traits get used to
cast those Effects. Both mages, when they’re within arm’s reach,
also get an amount of bonus Quintessence points that’s equal
to their Avatar rating; if Ryan Summers and his twin Sylvia
Jane have three dots in Avatar, they each get an additional three
points of Quintessence when they’re close enough to touch one
another. For details about collaborative spellcasting, see Acting
in Concert in Mage 20, pp. 542-543. Shared souls, however,
also share equally in any Paradox gathered by their magicks,
with each twin separately getting the full amount of Paradox. If
Ryan or Sylvia casts an Effect that earns 10 points of Paradox,
then both Ryan and Sylvia get 10 Paradox points each.
Whether or not your twin is a mage, you can use magick
to keep track of them once you’ve met your twin. A single dot
of Correspondence will let you know where your soulmate is, a
single dot in Life will let you know their current state of health,
and a single dot in Mind allows you to share thoughts with
one another. A twin’s death, however, is a shattering event; if
your twin dies, you must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 8) or
else suffer the psychic shock of Things Man Was Not Meant
to Know. Until that twin’s Avatar reincarnates (which might
not happen in your own lifetime), and is met in person once
again, you cannot use the shared powers you had once enjoyed.
As with other character-based Traits, your twin is not a
walking Merit but a character in their own right. Both twins
could be roleplayed by different players in the same group, and
probably should not be played by the same player. The quest to
find a soulmate, a bitter dispute between soulmates, two soulmates on opposing factions of the Ascension War – such stories
could provide the foundation for pivotal events and themes
in your chronicle. This Merit goes well with the Background:
Allies, the Merit: True Love, and the Flaws: Enemy, Sleeping
with the Enemy, and Ward. Because of the already-Awakened
natures of the Night-Folk, however, a soul-twin cannot be a
vampire, werecreature, changeling, or other paranormal entity.
Umbral Affinity (4 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 644.
Unbondable (4 pt. Merit)
Your soul remains free from the vampiric blood bond, and
resistant to other forms of metaphysical fealty. Although you
may still be compelled into service through Sphere magick,
or impressed by dominating powers like vampiric Presence
or changeling Chicanery, your Willpower is considered to be
two dots higher with regards to resisting such domination.
(See Mage 20, p. 519, and Influence-Magick Difficulties and
Resistance, Recognition, and Duration in How Do You DO
That?, pp. 116-117.)
A rare and potent Merit, this gift may cost double its usual
cost in a chronicle that’s filled with vampires, especially if the
mages in that chronicle make a habit of guzzling vampire blood…
Ghoul (5 pt. Merit)
The blood of vampiric Kindred has made you something
more than human. Willingly or otherwise, you have supped
on a vampire’s blood, and although you’re probably not bloodbound to her service any longer (unless you are), that creature’s
unnatural vitality has become your own. Trouble is, you need
more vitae to sustain your uncanny abilities… and, as many
mages have discovered, such blood is exceedingly addictive.
A ghouled character ages very slowly, gets one automatic
success on any Strength-based roll, and inflicts one extra die
of damage with all hand-to-hand, non-magickal attacks. If
your chronicle employs Vampire: The Masquerade rules, your
character also has a blood pool, one dot in Potence, and the
potential to buy and employ Fortitude, Potence, and an ability
from the initiating vampire’s clan.
That’s the good part; the bad parts involve the constant
craving for more vitae, the loss of those supernatural bonuses
after roughly a month without vampire blood, several dots
in Resonance (or the Echoes Flaw, detailed in Mage 20, pp.
646-647) that reflect the corrupt nature of the undead, and
the obvious drawbacks of hanging around with vampires just
so you can drink their blood.
Clear Sighted (5 pt. Merit)
Even without employing your Arts, you have a preternatural gift for seeing things as they are, not as they appear to be.
Illusions, disguises, cloaking spells, and other forms of trickery
rarely deceive your eyes.
In game terms, you can make a Perception + Awareness
roll to see through metaphysical deception powers: vampiric
Disciplines, faerie cantrips, werecreature Gifts, Sphere-based
illusions, and other powers that are based on deceiving a witnesses’ perceptions. This roll works only against powers that deceive
the target’s perceptions, not against any other form of Gift, Discipline,
cantrip, and so forth. (Vampiric Obfuscate, for example, but not
Presence or Dominate.)76 The Book of Secrets
Mages, the Blood Bond, and the Effects of Vitae
As mentioned nearby, mages can become ghouls, enjoying the benefits of vitae powers at the cost of hunger and
the blood bond. A ghouled mage becomes a mystic addict, her thirst driving her to debase her higher calling. Even a
Nephandus avoids this state if she can help it. At best, the ghoul-thirst drives a mage to hunt and drain vampires – a
risky calling even for the most accomplished mystics!
More often, a ghouled mage becomes blood bound to the vampire from whom she feeds. Any character – mage or
otherwise – who drinks the blood of a certain vampire on three separate occasions becomes a blood-bound thrall
to that vampire. From that point onward, the character will do almost anything, short of obvious suicide, on behalf of
her regent. The regent can ask for, or even demand, service, and the thrall will feel compelled to fulfill that request.
If the regent tries to Dominate the thrall (using the vampiric Discipline of that name, as described in the Vampire:
The Masquerade rulebook), his difficulty is two levels lower than it would normally be. Good treatment deepens the
bond, and abuse lessens it but cannot fully dispel it. Only time, distance, and a significant effort of will can do that;
even then, a strong fascination remains.
Mages, willful creatures themselves, can try to resist the blood bond’s effects. If the mage tries to beat the bond, that
mage’s player needs to roll her Willpower against difficulty 8 and accumulate one success for each time the mage
has fed from that vampire (three successes minimum). If she makes that roll, the player must spend one Willpower
point each turn in order to resist the bond. The length of time for which the mage remains free depends upon what
she’s trying to do; if she’s simply plotting against the regent, the resistance can last a scene; if she’s trying to attack
him, the resistance lasts only a turn or two. After that, the compulsion returns – often mixed with a sense of regret for
having defied the master, and disgust at herself for having gotten into the situation to begin with.
Powerful magick can break the bond. Through a combination of Life 4, Mind 3, Entropy 3, and Prime 1 – plus at
least three dots in Lore (Vampires) – a mage can break the bond’s hold on another person (difficulty 8, successes as
above). A mage cannot, however, use that magick to break her own bond. One of the secret favors that the Order of
Hermes owes to the Verbena Tradition involves the Verbenae breaking blood bonds on several dozen Hermetic magi.
Even without the bond, a ghouled mage suffers a vicious addiction to vampire blood. In game terms, this counts as the
Addiction Flaw at its highest level, and she also becomes Deranged (again, as per that Flaw) through her obsession
with consuming more vitae. She enjoys the benefits of a typical ghoul, but she suffers the same pains, too.
As an optional rule, she might also suffer metaphysical corruption from that blood. If a mage remains ghouled – with
or without the blood bond – for one year for each point of Avatar + Arete, she begins to lose points from her Avatar
Background, at a rate of one point per year. Once the Avatar is gone, she begins to lose Arete… and after Arete is
gone, she loses the powers of Awakening forever. The thirst has consumed her soul… and for that reason, among
others, smart mages avoid the thirst for literal damnation.
The difficulty for that roll is generally 5 + the highest Sphere
Rank or other level involved in that power; a Forces 2 /Prime
2 illusion, then, would be difficulty 7, while a vampire’s Mask
of a Thousand Faces (Obfuscate 3) would be difficulty 8. If a
character could normally get a roll to see through the illusion
(as shown in How Do You DO That?, pp. 129-132), then your
character subtracts -3 from her difficulty when trying to do so.
Your clear sight also reduces your difficulty by -3 when you
try to see through a disguise, a cloaking spell or device, or other
attempts to conceal the truth from an onlooker. It does not,
however, allow you to see through darkness, notice stealthing
or invisible characters, or otherwise perceive something that
you would not be able to see without this Merit; combining this
Merit with the physical Merit: Acute Senses, however, could
make you a formidably perceptive character.
“Immortal” (5 or 7 pt. Merit)
Thanks to some uncanny gift, you age slowly (if at all) and
are extremely hard to kill. This gift comes not from Sphere
magick but from a metaphysical legacy or curse that transcends
the fleeting nature of the flesh. You’re not truly immortal, as
death will probably claim you eventually; by normal standards,
though, you exist outside of the usual range of human mortality.
This Merit features two levels:
• (5 points) You age very slowly – perhaps one year for
every passing decade – and eventually recover (at the
usual speed) from any injuries and illnesses that do
not immediately kill you outright. A wasting disease or
infection, for instance, won’t kill you (though you might
wish it would), but a bullet in the heart would do so.
• (7 points) In addition to the slow-aging process, you’re also
immune to death itself unless you meet yourspecial doom(as
described below) or have your body completely obliterated.
Shooting won’t kill you, poison won’t kill you, starvation
won’t kill you, but being incinerated or dissolved in acid
would end your life for good. Otherwise, your wounds heal
at the usual rate, eventually bringing you back from the
dead… which, if you’ve been buried, embalmed, entombed,
or otherwise trapped could be a very bad thing for you!Chapter One: Heroic Traits 77
Regardless of the level of this Merit, you must have at least
one special doom: an event that will kill your ass dead for good.
This doom could involve decapitation, burning of your body,
immersion in salt water, removal of the eternal revivification
unit installed within your heart, and so forth. This doom must
be determined before the chronicle begins, and if it ever befalls
you… well, life was fun while it lasted, right?
This Merit goes well with Traits like the Background: Legend, the Supernatural Merits: Mark of Favor, Nephilim, Spark
of Life, and Twin Souls, or the Supernatural Flaws: Phylactery
and Primal Marks. (See the appropriate entries throughout this
section.) It cannot be taken in addition to the Merit: Nine Lives
(also in this section) and, for obvious reasons, this Merit might
not be available to player characters within your chronicle at all.
Inner Knight (5 pt. Merit)
In your heart of hearts, you’re a hero. While your companions work toward their own selfish ends, you embody a
higher purpose. This purpose guides you in uncanny ways that
feel, at times, as if you’re being moved by a force greater than
yourself – a noble force, naturally, but one that transcends even
your personal Enlightenment. In dreams, you see yourself as a
Warrior of Reason, a Champion of Truth. A paladin. A genius.
A knight of everything that is worth defending.
Intended more for Technocratic operatives and skeptical
technomancers than for mages who accept reincarnation as a
metaphysical truth, this Merit grants you special gifts when it
seems like all hope has been lost. These gifts allow you to…
• access Traits you don’t possess, as per the Background:
Dream (at a rating of 5) but without entering a trance;
• add five temporary points to your Willpower Trait, to
use during that “hope is lost” crisis;
• …and perhaps recall things from a previous life that the
character could not possibly have known – a language
she does not know, an escape route in a place he’s never
visited, a person they’ve never met before, and so forth.
These boosts last only through the current scene, but
include a burst of vitalizing energy and a sense of your inner
hero coming through to save the day again.
This isn’t the sort of thing you talk about, of course, especially
not if you’re an agent of the Technocratic Union. The benefits,
though, cannot be denied, even if their source is clearly… well,
improbable, at best. And while this Merit was originally created
for the sourcebook Guide to the Technocracy, any mage with
a sense of higher purpose can take it. Just remember that the
biggest difference between a knight and a murderer is the side
of his sword you happen to be on at the time.
Legendary Attributes (5 pt. Merit)
Gifted with the strength of Shango or the beauty of Lucifer,
you may exceed the human capacity for one Attribute Trait.
That Trait is not automatically higher than usual (you still need
to spend points to raise the favored Attribute), but you may
purchase up to six dots in a given Attribute for your character,
exceeding the usual limit of five dots.
Beyond that higher maximum, you also get one heroic
capability that’s linked to that Attribute. The Shango-strength
mage might always inflict at least one health level of damage
with hand-to-hand blows, while the Luciferian seducer could
score an automatic success whenever he tries to charm someone
who ought to know better. These bonuses are always subject
to Storyteller approval, however, and they don’t kick in until
you reach six dots in the given Trait. Not even Lucifer, after
all, possessed his full charm when he was just a little devil…
Powerful Ally (5 to 8 pt. Merit)
You’ve got seriously badass friends – a vampire lord, a faerie
noble, a werewolf pack, Umbrood courtiers, or other similarly
magnificent entities. In most respects, this is the Supernatural
Companion Merit but with a much higher power-level… a
level which might be beyond the capacity of mages below the
Master rank. And while the Storyteller determines who your
friends are, what they can do, and what they want out of their
relationship with you, the value of this Merit depends upon
their relative benefit to you:
• (5 points) One buddy of considerable power and influence within his community – a Prince of the City, a
Garou elder, and so forth.
• (6 points) A small group of Supernatural Companions
(five or so), or an especially powerful representative of
his kind.
• (7 points) A larger group of Companions (around a
dozen), or two or three powerful friends.
• (8 points) Over a dozen Companions, a handful of
powerful friends, or one ally of near-godlike power.
Again, the Storyteller decides who these allies are, why
they’re interested in your goodwill, and what the cost of their
aid might be. You get nothing for nothing, after all, especially
not when such beings are involved! For a commensurate level
of enemies, see the Flaw: Immortal Enemy, p. 93.
Shattered Avatar (5 pt. Merit)
Your Avatar has been broken into pieces by some past-life
trauma. As a result, the part within you is incomplete… but that
situation can be rectified. If and when you locate the missing
pieces of your Avatar, you could make that inner spirit stronger.
In gamespeak, this Merit allows you to increase your Avatar
Background after character creation – a thing that cannot,
ordinarily, be done. (See Mage 20, p. 336.)
As with Twin Souls, above, this Merit provides plenty of
dramatic story hooks. The missing pieces of your Avatar might
be incarnated in other people; trapped in spiritual prisons78 The Book of Secrets
(Paradox Realms, demonic hells, soulsnares, enchanted gems, and so forth);
embedded in a tree in a garden that’s
warded by five dragons, and so on.
The quest for your soul-fragments
can be an epic part of your chronicle, with puzzles, twists, reversals,
betrayals, and battles for which
your soul is literally the prize.
This sort of thing might be hard
to reconcile with your beliefs
if, for example, you happen
to be a Technocrat. Still, until
you unite the missing bits of
your Avatar, there’ll be an
essential part of you that feels
incomplete.
The Storyteller should
determine exactly what it was
that shattered your Avatar,
and what you need to do
in order to reunite the
various bits into one spirit
again. Whether or not she
shares that information
with you is up to her – it
might be something you’ll
discover over the course of
the game. With each piece
restored, you add one dot
to your Avatar Background
rating, unless that Avatar was
embodied in another mage;
in that case, his Avatar rating
gets added to your own if you
manage to kill him… and if he
kills you first, then your Avatar
gets added to his own. (There
can, apparently, be only one.)
No matter how many
pieces are involved, however, the
Avatar Background maxes out at
5 dots. Although this Merit allows you to
raise your Trait’s rating, it does not allow
you to raise it above that level.
Spark of Life
(5 pt. Merit)
Blessed with great vitality, you heal injuries
with heroic speed and ease. Your own injuries
from lethal damage heal as if they were bashing
damage (see the Healing Damage chart in Mage
20, p. 406), and aggravated damage heals as if it
were one level higher than it is. (Wounded-level
damage, for instance, would heal
at the Injured-level rate.) Bashing
damage, regardless of its extent,
heals within an hour.
If you’re trying to heal someone
else, you subtract -2 from the difficulty of the roll, even if that roll involves
casting a Life Sphere healing Effect.
(The usual +3 maximum modifier
and minimum difficulty of 3 still
apply – seeMage 20,p.503.) As long
as you remain in physical touch
with the injured party, that
character uses your healing
rate as her own. Your touch
also soothes minor pains –
muscle spasms, headaches,
and so forth – within a
minute or two.
Beyond its healing powers, this rush of life-energy
simply feels good, too. Your
aura shines with bright
vitality, and your Resonance reflects your strong
connection to the primal
life-force. On the inevitable downside, vampires
find your blood delicious
– twice as potent as normal
human vitae (worth double the
usual blood points, for players of
Vampire: The Masquerade) – and
unspeakably refreshing.
Guardian Angel
(6 pt. Merit)
A powerful entity is watching over
you, providing advice, assistance, and
occasional protection when things get ugly.
Such aid is beyond your control (perhaps
even beyond your comprehension) and while
this “angel” has certainly supported your best
interests thus far, there could be a terrible pricetag attached to all this help. You think your
angel is of the better sort, but seriously – have
you read the lore about angels? Sweetness and
light are not among their more noted characteristics.
From a Merit perspective, this Trait provides occasional
help from the Storyteller. The nature of said help is entirely up
to the Storyteller, although it should be beneficial in at least the
short term. The help in question should also suit the nature of
the mage and her paradigm, although that suitability might turn
out to be rather ironic – an actual angel, for example, watchingChapter One: Heroic Traits 79
over an Infernalist mage, or a nature spirit protecting an avowed
Technocrat. The helpful party may be waiting for the mage to
“see the light,” honoring an ancient vow to the mage’s ancestors,
leading the protected party toward a new and unexpected Path,
or perhaps setting him up for a final revelation that could be
more terrible than the things the angel has been driving away.
From a Storyteller standpoint, we recommend playing
up the mysterious and potentially frightening nature of this
guardian “angel.” Legendary angels tend to be notoriously
bloody in their work, and can scare the living hell of mortals
even when their intentions are technically righteous. As a
Storyteller, determine who is helping the mage out, and why;
that information, of course, can be for you to know and your
players to wonder about. Whenever the angel manifests, play
up the implacable weirdness of such entities, couching their
appearances in eerie symbolism and elemental phenomena
(winds, fires, earthquakes, and so forth) whenever they appear.
(For suggestions, see Mage 20, pp. 356-359 and 363-367.)
Conversely, the angel could be an apparently mundane
person or animal who just happens to unleash hell on the
mage’s behalf. The animal spirits, minions, and elementals
described in Mage 20, Appendix I, represent the more sedate
end of the guardian angel spectrum; stranger beings could include protoplasmic globs, shimmering energies, horrific beasts,
and unnamable things that serve powers best undreamed of.
Even if the angel is exactly that – a messenger from the Biblical
God – such messengers can be pretty frightening. Check out
Ezekiel 1-10, Genesis 3, Revelations 4, and other awe-inspiring
manifestations. If the Powers That Be behind this guardian
angel are more along the lines of Pagan gods or cosmic horrors,
this unearthly Merit could unleash some rather scary things…
Nine Lives (6 pt. Merit)
Oh, you lucky bastard! Somehow, you manage to cheat
the Reaper with hair-raising regularity. If a die roll would result
in your character’s death, the person who made that roll must
roll again. If the second roll allows your character to live, then
you and /or your Storyteller mark off one of your nine “lives”
and your character survives the thing that would otherwise
have killed her. If that roll fails, then one “life” gets marked
off anyway and another roll is made. The rolls continue until
either the character survives or the lives get used up. As the
name suggests, however, this Merit lasts only nine times, tops.
And if the final die roll still results in your character’s death…
well, your luck was bound to run out sooner or later anyway.
Sphere Natural (6 pt. Merit)
For a single element of magick – the Sphere of your choice –
you enjoy an innate proficiency. The powers of that Sphere come
to you more easily than usual, and you advance faster in that
field of knowledge than you do in other Spheres. System-wise,
you pay 70% of the usual experience cost, rounded up, when
advancing in that Sphere. Naturally, such advancement costs
even less when you’re raising your Affinity Sphere.
Rank Cost /Affinity Sphere Cost
New Sphere: 7 pts.
2 6 /5 pts.
3 11 /10 pts.
4 17 /15 pts.
5 23 /20 pts.
The Mage 20 version of this Merit costs more than the version presented in previous editions because the cost of improving
Spheres with experience has gone down, and so the benefits
involved in this Merit have gone up. You may select this Merit
only once, for a single Sphere, and that Sphere should have some
intrinsic connection to your mage’s concept, backstory, and
magickal focus. This is, after all, an Art that comes naturally to
you, and so that predisposition should come through in many
different aspects of your character’s personality.
Avatar Companion (7 pt. Merit)
From lifetime to lifetime, you share a bit of your Avatar
with a companion who follows you through incarnations,
recalling more about their details than you do. Although
he’s not as powerful as you are, and lacks the metaphysical
prowess of the Merits: Twin Soul or Shattered Avatar (above),
this companion knows a great deal about your reincarnated
self… quite a bit more about it than you do. This loyal (if
not always agreeable) character literally follows you for life,
typically ending his life when you do; in the meantime, he
provides insights, advice, information about previous lifetimes, and whatever other forms of aid he can possibly offer.
Like the Merit: Guardian Angel, the Avatar Companion is
essentially a walking boost from your Storyteller, subject to
her whims but acting in your best interests… for the most
part, anyway.
Unless it’s purchased in addition to the Background:
Allies, your companion isn’t anything special; he could be
a person or animal, but not a vampire, a werebeast, or some
other Night-Folk entity. Your Avatar Companion could also be
a Ward, the focus of True Love, or perhaps an embodiment
of a Manifest Avatar. Treat him badly enough, and he might
become an Enemy. (See all appropriate entries for details.) As
with all other character-based Traits, this companion has his
own personality, desires, and so on. He may be loyal, but he’s
not suicidal, and isn’t likely to be thrilled if the mage decides
to abuse his loyalty!
Dual Affiliation (7 pt. Merit)
You’ve been initiated and trained in two different Awakened
groups. Perhaps you were a Verbena who gravitated toward the
Virtual Adepts, or a Man in Black who sought refuge among the
Templars. Whatever your history and affiliations might be, you’re
intimately familiar with both groups, have connections (not necessarily friends) in both groups, and may use and understand the
practices, tools and beliefs (in short, the focus) of either group.80 The Book of Secrets
Rules-wise, your mage enjoys the benefits of each affiliation. If he’s a former Technocrat who went over to the mystic
side, he can still use technomagick while transcending the
usual Technocratic bans regarding Arete and focus. When
raising a Sphere, your character gets to use the Affinity
Sphere rate for one Sphere per group. His former associates
probably don’t view him very favorably, though, unless he
“cross-trained” within friendly groups, like a Dreamspeaker
who went Ecstatic or a Hermetic who joined the Children
of Knowledge.
For additional details about this subject, see Chapter
Three’s Focus FAQ, p. 174.
Nephilim /Laham (7 pt. Merit)
Long ago, it has been said, immortals walked the
earth, siring offspring whose descendants still live among
us now. The Hebrew Bible refers to them as nephilim, an
ambiguous word that seems to be related to root words for
“fallen,” “prisoners,” and “overseers.” Later transliterations
refer to them as giants, monsters, watchers, and the fallen (or
violent) ones. Were they gods? Angels? Demons? Not even
the Awakened know for sure; you, however, have a bit of
High Umbral essence within you, and this nephilim inheritance – known sometimes by the demon-blooded name of
laham – marks you as something more than merely human
(Awakened or otherwise).
A living crossroads between the Astral Realm and the
mortal world, you exist in a heightened state of spiritual
essence. Your aura burns with unearthly intensity, and
your presence frightens many Otherworldly denizens. Your
connection to High Umbral entities might involve a distant
relationship to primordial sires, or the far more recent activities of mortals and spirits who shared a distinctly carnal
relationship. (“Mom, seriously – I need to know the truth about
Dad”) Are you part-demon? Descended from an angel? Sired
by an entity whose nature transcends mortal concepts like
“good” and “evil”? You probably don’t even know, although
events in your chronicle might reveal the truth whether you
want to learn it or not.
System-wise, this Merit confers the following drawbacks
and benefits:
• As noted above, your aura blazes with inhuman clarity
and brilliance.
• Your temperament favors your Umbral ancestor, and
you tend to act accordingly.
• You must take at least three points’ worth of Physical
Flaws to reflect the unstable nature of your physical form and the surging metaphysical energies it
contains. These Flaws do not count toward your
total Flaw points, nor do you get points for taking
those Flaws.
• Those energies give you a Quintessence rating of 7, and
those points automatically refresh up to that seven-point
maximum each time you go to sleep, regardless of your
Avatar rating.
• Ifyour chronicle employs theResonancerules inChapter
Two, you begin play with three points in Resonance,
not one. If not, you get three points’ worth of the Flaw:
Echoes. Again, those phenomena reflect the temperament of your Umbral ancestor.
• You subtract -1 from the difficulties of your casting rolls
when you cast Effects using the Mind Sphere, the Spirit
Sphere, or both in relation to the High Umbra. If, for
example, the demon-blooded laham mage Jenatrix wanted
to read someone’s mind, her casting difficulty would be
normal; if she wanted to project her astral self into the
High Umbra, however, she’d reduce the difficulty by -1.
• You can travel physically into the High Umbra by using
a Mind 4 /Spirit 3 Effect.
• When attempting to intimidate, command, or bargain
with High Umbral entities, you add two dice to whichever dice pool you happen to be using in that attempt.
(For details, see The Bargaining Process in How Do
You DO That? pp. 91-95.) Despite your advantage,
however, using your uncanny heritage as leverage will
not exactly endear you to the entities in question. In
such negotiations, it’s generally more constructive to
use a carrot than a stick.
• On a related note, you suffer a penalty of +2 to the difficulty of your rolls to resist, soak or counter rituals cast
by Hermetic High Ritual wizards or Awakened clerics
from the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian denominations.
These folks have spent millennia studying your kind,
and be ye angel or be ye demon, they know how to deal
with you more effectively than most mages do. (Byrituals,
we’re referring to extended-roll ceremonial magicks, not
off-the-cuff spells. Your chances are as good as anybody
else’s if a wizard tosses a lightning bolt at you; if he draws
up a summoning circle, though, you’re kinda screwed.)
• At the Storyteller’s option, you may also receive up to seven points in the Advantages described in Mage 20, p.
658 (and expanded further in the Mage 20 sourcebook
Gods, Monsters & Familiar Strangers). Demon-blooded
laham characters may, instead, take up to seven points
in the demonic Investments described in the Mage:
The Sorcerers Crusade sourcebook Infernalism: The
Path of Screams or the Mage 20 supplement The
Book of the Fallen. In either case, these additional
and optional benefits get balanced out with a five-point
Derangement Flaw of the Storyteller’s choice (see Mage
20, pp. 648-650).Chapter One: Heroic Traits 81
Although the player might not know what sort of entity
her character is descended from, the Storyteller ought to determine the character’s heritage, and then plant clues (dreams,
visions, weird greetings from characters who seem to know more
about the mage than she knows about herself…) throughout
the story. He ought to feed roleplaying notes to the player, too:
This Realm seems familiar even though you don’t recall having been
here before, You can almost taste the evil in that girl’s soul, Man, you
just wanna rip that dude’s throat out and you’re not sure why… The
player, of course, can draw her own conclusions – conclusions
that might not necessarily be accurate at all.
This Merit goes well with Merits likeLegendary Attributes,
Nine Lives, and Too Tough to Die, Flaws like Immortal Enemy, Primal Marks, or Cast No Shadow or Reflection, and
Backgrounds like Cult, Demesne, and Past Life. As with the
Merit: “Immortal,” (above) this Trait could be too powerful
for player characters to take. Supporting characters, however,
could be nephilim-descended, which would make for potent
friends and memorable enemies.
True Faith (7 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, pp. 644-646.
Supernatural Flaws
The strangeness of Awakened life brings perils as well as
power. And while mortals occasionally suffer such bizarre fates
too, the following Flaws embody the uglier side of magick’s gifts.
As mentioned under the heading forSupernatural Merits,
several of the Flaws presented in earlier editions have not been
included below. Generally, that’s because they’re redundant with
other Traits; the old Flaw: Denial, for instance, is redundant
with its namesake form of Quiet, (described in Mage 20, pp.
556-557), while Touch of Frost is a manifestation of the Flaw:
Echoes. On the other hand, many of the revised Traits formerly
known as Adversarial Backgrounds (detailed at the beginning
of the Merits and Flaws section) have become Supernatural
Flaws, as described below under Jinx, Uncanny, and other
variable-point Flaws.
Anachronism (1 to 3 pt. Flaw)
Time has passed you by… or maybe it simply hasn’t
caught up with you yet. Your beliefs, personality, mannerisms,
fashion, and expectations are radically out of step with your
surroundings. This could be a deliberate affection on your part
(“The Old Days were better than today” /“Why wait for the future to
arrive when you can become the future?”), a Time Sphere-related
temporal hiccup or Paradox Flaw, the result of paranormal
longevity or back-tracking time travel, the manifestation of an
especially assertive past (or future) life… hell, even you might
not know quite why you’re like this, but you are, and the rest
of the world can’t help but notice.
The value of this Flaw depends upon the amount of trouble
you get into as a result of your anachronisms:
• (1 point) You seem a little weird, and potentially offensive (“Why are they not sitting in the back of the bus? Aren’t
there laws about that sort of thing?”), displaying quirks
from a recognizably different past or future that isn’t
radically behind or ahead of the current age. Add +1 to
the difficulty of understanding current technology and
modes of behavior.
• (2 points) You’re a relic of a distinctly earlier age, or the
harbinger of a seriously advanced one. The things you
say, wear, expect, and believe are disturbingly out of touch
with your surroundings, and can present significant
problems… especially if and when you hold forth on silly
little things like politics, social mores, sexuality, and the
law. Current technology puzzles you, either because it’s
inexplicably advanced or staggeringly primitive. Add +2
to the difficulty of all efforts to understand your current
era, including social rolls based upon getting along with
people in this age.
• (3 points) You hail from a time so distant that the current
era seems as alien to you as you seem to people of this
era. Hell, you might not even speak English (a common
trait of folks who existed before the expansion of British
and American influence in the 1800s), or speak your
language with an accent and idioms that essentially turn
it into another language entirely (think Shakespeare,
or Anthony Burgess’ novel A Clockwork Orange). Your
expectations regarding technology and social mores are
wildly divergent, and you could easily get yourself into
serious trouble. Add +3 to the appropriate rolls, and
you may be unable to process certain things (driving,
politics, current computer tech, etc.) at all.
Assuming you have a chance to acclimate to your surroundings, this Flaw can be bought down with experience points.
Until that time, your companions will have a lot of explaining
to do on your behalf!
Apprentice (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Most metaphysical societies, the Technocracy included,
employ a mentor /apprentice system. During a members’ early
years, an elder member is assigned to, or chooses to, teach
a new and inexperienced member. During the later days of
membership, an elder is expected to pass on their experience
to the younger generation. In addition to the usual training
programs a given group may purse, a new recruit often winds
up in the care of a seasoned member of that group. And in
the case of this Flaw, you’ve got a real winner on your hands.
When you mentor an apprentice a mentor, you’re responsible for someone (whatever his formal title might be) who makes
your life difficult. You can’t just kick this person to the curb,
but must instead provide discipline, guidance, training, and
quite often a support system (room, board, research space, and
so forth) so that the newbie can become a successful member82 The Book of Secrets
of your sect. An apprentice, however, is not a houseplant; even
the most cooperative apprentices demand time and attention,
and their deeds – good and otherwise – reflect upon your own
social status. The more troublesome ones, by extension, can
drive a mentor toward curmudgeonly solitude.
As a Flaw, this Trait reflects the range of potential apprentices and the effect they have upon your life:
• (1 point) A cooperative and dedicated ideal student
who takes up very little of your space and time, reflects
well upon you, and seems eager to learn from you while
being reluctant to argue very much.
• (2 points) A typical student who needs a fair amount
of hand-holding; makes occasional mistakes of protocol
and discipline; and takes up a fair amount of time, space
and patience. Even so, this person remains attentive and
more or less respectful, providing plenty of reasons for
you to be proud of him.
• (3 points) A rather clueless student whose presence
consumes a significant amount of time and attention.
This apprentice can be clumsy, obnoxious, thick-witted,
and occasionally problematic in social situations and
training exercises. He’s got promise, but it’s going to
take a lot of work to get him to realize his potential.
• (4 points) A seriously challenging student whose behavior and dedication leave a great deal to be desired. This
apprentice may have talent, but the burdens begin to
outweigh the potential benefits of his instruction.
• (5 points) An obstinate, haughty, disrespectful ass whose
presence is more trouble than it’s worth. Dangerous to
himself and everyone around him (yourself included),
he’s a disgrace to the society you share. Why are you
training this person, again? There might be a light at
the end of the tunnel someday, but it’s gonna take a lot
of work and sacrifice before this apprentice amounts to
anything more than a waste of your time.
Again, this is a person for whom you are responsible.
Unless you dedicate lots of time, attention, and often monetary resources toward bettering his condition, your apprentice
could get worse as time goes on. Conversely, you might be able
to mold a troublesome apprentice into an exemplar of your
society. From a game-system standpoint, you can lower the value
of this Flaw through dedicated work – the obstinate five-point
troublemaker could eventually become a one-point ideal student
if you put in the time, work, and roleplaying to make him so.
Storytellers: Allow your player to buy this Flaw down through
experience if and when she makes an effort to straighten up
a problematic apprentice, but also feel free to raise the Flaw’s
drawbacks if the player lets things slide too often and too far.
Despite the usual preconceptions of age and experience,
an apprentice could be older than his mentor. He may have
originally belonged to a different sect (say, a Verbena defecting
to the New World Order or Bata’a), and has a head full of ideas
about how things “should” be done – ideas that run counter to
your own teachings. Or he might be a new mage who Awakened
in middle age, and who therefore has problems taking orders
from an experienced mage he considers to be a kid. Even the best
students make mistakes, and so no level of this Flaw is without
headaches – that, after all, is why it’s considered a Flaw!
Once again, this character-based Trait represents a full-fledged
Storyteller character whose personality, needs, problems, and
agendas make him far more than just a list of dots on a character
sheet. In an experienced roleplaying trope, you might let another
player run this apprentice, as either a supporting character or as
their main mage. In such cases, of course, the student will be less
powerful and experienced than the teacher, unless he began his
Awakened life as a mage from a different group. In any case, the
apprentice ought to be a major part of the chronicle, and may
eventually even become the center of the tale (as in the Harry
Potter saga) if and when the apprenticeship goes well. A rotten
apprenticeship, on the other hand, could still earn that character a
starring role in the chronicle: as an antagonist whose close history
with the mage just makes the fight nastier for everyone involved.
The Bard’s Tongue (1 pt. Flaw)
A curse has rendered you unable to lie. It may even compel
you to speak the truth when you struggle to remain silent. Worse
still, you tend to say things that later turn out to be true even if
you hadn’t known anything about them at the time. (“Don’t try
and score food from that guy over there – he’s got a gun and is having
a really bad day.”) You often get a certain “look” when the urge
to speak truth comes up, and folks who know you have begun
to recognize the signs of a forthcoming “honesty blast” before
you even open your mouth.
Life and Mage chronicles are both filled with times when
it’s best to keep a lid on the truth. And so, in order to avoid
saying speaking the proverbial inconvenient truth (or worse),
you need to spend a Willpower point to keep your mouth shut
about it. Repressing that truth may also cost you one health level
in bashing damage if the truth you’re clamping down on is one
of those “things that really must be said” which isn’t a smart
thing to say under the circumstances. (“Yeah, Agent Courage,
everybody knows you work every angle with every group – that’s not
exactly a ‘secret,’ now is it?”)
Cast No Shadow or Reflection
(1 to 2 pt. Flaw)
According to certain legends, witches cast no shadow. And
while that isn’t true of most mages, it’s somehow true for you.
Maybe you suffer from a lingering Paradox Flaw, manifest your
own cultural fears, or made a bargain that cost you your shadow
or reflection. In any case, your shadow and /or reflection are
absent from your presence. For one point, you’re missing one of
those things, for two points you lack them both, and although
most folks won’t notice this consciously, they do tend to feelChapter One: Heroic Traits 83
uneasy in your presence even if they’re not sure why. (Technological machines record this phenomenon, too.) Add +1 to the
difficulty of all your Social-Trait rolls under most circumstances,
and +2 to the difficulty if a witness makes a perception-based roll
(difficulty 7) and figures out why you seem so weird.
Cursed (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, p. 646.
Devil’s Mark (1 pt. Flaw)
A pact or some other metaphysical occurrence has left you
with what old-school witch-hunters consider a “devil’s mark”: a
minor but noticeable deformation that remains insensate to pain
and yet allows a creature to draw your Quintessence out through
your body in physical form. Despite preconceptions, the origins
of this mark might not have come from a pact with some infernal
entity. That fact doesn’t keep people – Sleepers and otherwise –
from looking askance at you if and when this mark can be seen,
especially since there’s often something disconcerting about the
way it appears – a third nipple, a red or black growth, a vaguely
demonic face or sigil embedded in your flesh, and so forth.
Thankfully, you don’t have to worry too much about
witch-hunters in the technologically industrialized world.
(Other regions are a different story; even rural areas of socalled advanced nations still hold people who will harm or
kill someone who’s “different.”) The mark’s disconcerting
appearance, though, may lead you to cover it up anyway. Folks
who do believe old-fashioned ideas about “witches” will not take
kindly to that devilish brand, so it could become a real problem
under the wrong circumstances. On the plus side, however,
you actually can nurture a Familiar (as in the Background
Trait of that name) on the mark, and do so without physical
discomfort. Of course, the idea of a talking, midnight-blue
winged tarantula taking hits of Quintessence off your body
may be uncomfortable in its own right.
Echoes (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, pp. 646-647.
Paranormal Prohibition or Imperative
(2 to 8 pt. Flaw)
Also known as Geasa and Magical Prohibition or Imperative, this Flaw represents a thing you either must do, or are
forbiddenfrom doing, on pain of awful consequences. Generally,
this imperative comes from an oath you swore, a curse that was
inflicted upon you, or a legacy that follows your family lineage.
Faerie grudges, infernal pacts, godly inheritances, ancient prophecies, Fortean quirks of physics… any one of them can inflict
such a burden upon you. So long as you never cross that line,
you should be okay – and may, in fact, possess some blessing
(a Merit or Background Trait) that’s linked to this Flaw. Ah,
but life has a way of pushing us to do things we don’t want to
do, and that’s especially true in the case of people who have a
curse or geas upon their heads!
The value of this Flaw is based on your chances of violating the prohibition, and the consequences that occur if /
when you do:
• (1 point) You break the prohibition only with an easily
avoided circumstance (never kill a cat, go to London, or
have sex with a married person), or find it easy to fulfill
your imperative (you must shave all your hair off, walk
outside every day, or wear blue clothing).
• (2 points) Your prohibition is easy to break (never tell
a lie, leave your home town, or have sex with anyone),
or your imperative is challenging to fulfill (you must
always cover your head, walk at least three miles every
day, or go barefoot at all times).
• (3 points) It’s very hard to not break your prohibition
(never speak, have a home of your own, or fall in love
or lust with anyone), or to honor your imperative (you
must blindfold yourself every day even though you
can see, walk everywhere you go, or remain naked at
all times).
• (+1 point) Inconvenient consequences – you botch your
next three rolls, suffer a migraine, develop a rash for
several days, etc.
• (+2 points) Annoying consequences – you lose your
voice for a day, lose a die from all your pools for a week
due to constant pain, add +2 to all your social rolls
with members of your faction until you can atone from
breaking your oath, and so forth.
• (+3 points) Painful consequences – until you can atone,
you go blind or mute, lose one dot from an Attribute,
lose an Ally, Mentor, or Familiar, take the Flaw:
Oathbreaker (below), or suffer a similarly awful fate.
• (+4 points) Crippling consequences – until you atone,
your Avatar abandons you, you lose a total of three dots
from various Attributes, you take the Flaws:Oathbreaker,
Deranged or both, or else endure a related punishment.
• (+5 points) Fatal consequences – either you’re gonna
die soon, you’ll be whisked off to an Otherworldly
punishment Realm, or both. Atonement, if it’s even
possible, will be very harsh, so do NOT break this oath
or forsake this imperative!
This Flaw makes an excellent companion to numerous
Backgrounds (Familiar, Legend, Past Life, Totem, Wonder,
and potentially others at the Storyteller’s discretion) and Merits
(pretty much anything, really, depending on how you define
the source of that Merit). Although this does not reduce the
cost of that Trait (despite the description of this Flaw in Mage
Revised, which employed a complex and potentially abusive
rule system that’s not found in other World of Darkness games),84 The Book of Secrets
a Prohibition /Imperative can represent vows, obligations, and
/or legacies associated with the beneficial Trait. If, for example, Riordan Manseragh were to have sworn a mystic oath in
order to win his tiger-spirit familiar, that oath would represent
a Paranormal Imperative, with painful consequences (the loss of
his Familiar Background) if he breaks his promise.
Your Prohibition /Imperative must be tied in with your
character’s backstory, and probably has a connection to all
three elements of her magickal focus (paradigm, practice,
and instruments). The conditions must be something that
could conceivably present an obstacle for your character (no
prohibitions, for example, against having sex with Voormas, or
imperatives to get out of bed in the morning), and your Storyteller will, of course, make a point of throwing said obstacles
in your path at various points during the chronicle. That said,
we also urge Storytellers not to abuse this Flaw, or to apply it
out of proportion with the points the Flaw is worth.
Although it’s rather unusual, a technomancer could have
a metaphysical pact or prohibition too. She may, for instance,
need to work on a Mac, employ only steamtech, or invent all
of her own technology to avoid suffering some paranormal
malaise. Thus, this Flaw is not always “mystical” in nature, even
if the line separating mysticism from paranormal phenomena
is more a matter of semantics than of metaphysical principles.
Gremlin (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
There’s a perverse imp running around your home. Okay,
maybe it’s not an actual imp – it could be a malfunctioning
robot companion, a vain and selfish bioconstruct, a troublesome spirit, an obnoxious beast, that talking winged tarantula
we mentioned a few entries ago… the form of the creature
is unimportant. Like the above Flaw: Apprentice, this Trait
reflects a companion character who, despite being supposedly
on your side, remains a constant pain in your ass.
Originally presented as the adversarial Background for
Familiar, this Flaw becomes more significant as the power of
the creature, and its attendant nuisance, grows:
• (1 point) A creature of unusual, but minor, ability, which
busies itself with trivial annoyances.
• (2 points) An entity whose power and intellect (or at least
its cunning) make your life frustrating but not actively
hazardous.
• (3 points) A being of notable power whose mischief has
begun to shade into actual damage to your property,
health, status, and relationships.
• (4 points) A metaphysical pain in the tuchus whose
powers cause lasting harm to you and to the things you
consider precious.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 85
• (5 points) A walking plague of significant power and
malignancy. Said critter might not actually mean to be
bad, but its effects on your life are inescapably destructive.
As with an Apprentice Flaw, above, you bear a certain
amount of responsibility to this creature – it’s not simply your
enemy, or even a nemesis, but a being with whom you share a
vital bond. Also as per the Apprentice Flaw, your treatment of
this “gremlin” (a legendary being that sabotaged airplanes for
fun) may reduce or intensify the value of this Flaw. A formerly
malignant entity could be tamed and eventually become a Familiar (as in that Background), while a poorly-treated familiar
might become a gremlin, and a previously annoying gremlin
could be annoyed into becoming a serious threat to the mage
and his surroundings. As an optional rule, you might even – with
Storyteller approval – be able to purchase the Gremlin Flaw in
addition to the Familiar Background, to reflect a helpful yet
perpetually troublesome companion.
A gremlin, as with all other Trait-based characters, is an
entity in its own right. Chances are good that the trouble it
causes for your mage has an understandable foundation – a
reason that seems inexplicable to the mage yet remains perfectly
reasonable to the gremlin. A mage who explores the reasons
behind this misbehavior may calm her temperamental companion; then again, an attempt to understand the gremlin’s
grudge might only piss it off further…
Locked Vidare (1 pt. Flaw)
Mages view the Otherworldly Penumbra through a metaphysical perspective called the Vidare. Most of them can alter
that perspective by changing their point of view. Not you. For
you, the Periphery remains “locked” into a single perspective:
the glittering clarity of the Vidare Astral, the primal luminosity
of the Vidare Spiritus, or the rotting deathscape of the Vidare
Mortem. Essentially, your metaphysical perspective is frozen
in place. This is literally the way you view the world around
you, and that view never really changes. (For details about the
Vidare and the impressions they present, see Mage 20, pp. 82,
89, 94-95, 98-99, and 474.)
In addition to shaping the way your Storyteller describes the
Vidare to you, and guiding your reaction to what you perceive,
this Flaw also influences your personality, your sense of fashion,
your philosophical and metaphysical paradigms, your magickal
focus, and so on. When you perceive things in a certain way,
after all, that perspective tends to color most aspects of your life.
Strangeness (1 pt. Flaw)
Your metaphysical prowess occasionally warps reality in
your presence, even when you don’t want it to do so. Weird
stuff happens when you’re not expecting such phenomena, and
those quirks of strangeness seem to be rooted in the sort of
magick you pursue. A specialist in Entropy could suffer twists
of probability and decay; a Life-attuned healer discovers odd
growths and mutations in the life-forms around him, while a
Forces-gifted mage bends the physics in his general vicinity.
These phenomena ebb and flow without your guidance or
control. Perversely, the more skilled you become in magick,
the stronger these tides of weirdness become.
System-wise, the Storyteller determines, once or twice per
game session, to roll your Arete against difficulty 6. If the roll
succeeds, the Storyteller throws in some random occurrence
that’s based on a Sphere you possess – most often, on your
Affinity Sphere. Grass could grow suddenly, mirrors could crack,
psychic impressions could inform you of the sexual habits of the
person standing next to you in the elevator – that sort of thing.
If the roll fails, then nothing unusual occurs. If the roll
botches, however, then a Paradox backlash expels one point
of Paradox in your current pool for each dot you have in
your Affinity Sphere; or all of your current Paradox, if you
have fewer points than that in your Paradox pool. (If, as an
example, Jinx has three dots in Entropy but only one point
of Paradox, the backlash dispels that one point in a backlash.)
These small backlashes won’t be terribly damaging, but given
the unpredictable nature of this Flaw, they could come at very
inconvenient times.
Throwback (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Haunted by a past life (often as per the Background
Trait of that name, described above), you suffer from awful
memories and act out in ways that are, shall we say, not productive to your current incarnation. Perhaps you still loathe
the clergymen who tortured a former “you” for witchcraft 400
years ago; the smell of cooking meat still sends you into panic
attacks. Or you’ll get vertigo and acrophobic surges from that
time a previous incarnation fell off a castle wall. You may slip
into archaic accents, foreign languages, or terminology that is
not exactly au courant (or socially acceptable) in today’s world.
Flashbacks, time segues, inappropriate behavior – it’s all part
of the package in this life you lead today.
For each point in this Flaw, up to a maximum of five points
(and dice), the Storyteller will roll one die against difficulty 8
when the potential arises for a past life to affect your present
life. The more successes he rolls, the more that past life affects
you. The symptoms of this “throwback syndrome” generally
depend upon the Storyteller’s whim, but you could collaborate with him to hash out a backstory (or several backstories)
for the previous incarnations your character recalls, and then
roleplay symptoms that seem appropriate to those histories. For
especially strong flashbacks (three successes or more), you may
need to roll your Willpower (again, difficulty 8) to suppress the
reaction to what your character recalls.
Described in Guide to the Traditions as an adversarial
Background of Past Life, this Flaw makes a fitting companion
to that Background, the Dream Background, and to other
Merits and Flaws related to reincarnation (Twin Souls, Shattered Avatar, and similar Traits described within this section).
With a few appropriate changes to the symptoms, you could
also describe the Throwback Flaw as manifestations of a Legend Background, or as memories from a life that goes back86 The Book of Secrets
several centuries. You’d rather forget the things you did, and
endured, back during the Conquest of the Americas, but you
never really can.
Uncanny (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
No matter how unobtrusive you try to be, you remain remarkably memorable to anyone who encounters you. You’re the
very opposite of “arcane,” which is why this Flaw was originally
described as an adversarial Background for the Trait of that
name; rather than moving through life with near-invisibility,
you stand out like a HIT Mark at a Verbena barbeque.
Why are you memorable, exactly? Is it an inhuman glow
behind your eyes? An unsettling tone in your voice? A metaphysical miasma that hangs about you despite your apparently
mundane appearance? Does grass grow or die in your shadow?
Maybe dogs cower when they sense your approach. There could
be a low buzzing in your presence, like a chorus of flies, or a
disconcerting crackle of electricity that radiates from your
skin, disrupting electrical systems in small but noticeable ways.
Whatever it is that causes people to remember you, that facet
of your presence is a constant reminder that you are not like
other folk.
Once again, the point-value of this Flaw depends upon
the extent to which it interferes with your life:
• (1 point) You stand out in a crowd.
• (2 points) It’s pretty hard to conceal your oddities.
• (3 points) People remember you long after you’re gone.
• (4 points) You creep people out simply by existing.
• (5 points) You scare people simply by existing.
By its nature, this Flaw represents an unmistakable impression. Each point in this Flaw adds one die to the dice pool of
anyone who’s trying to notice you, recognize you, or penetrate
your attempts at stealth or concealment. (You didn’t really think
those wailing damned souls were gonna shut up just because
you were trying to get past the guards, now did you?) You may,
however, attempt to cover up your uncanny presence with a
roll of Intelligence + Subterfuge, assuming you have a method
of doing so – it’s easier to conceal your glowing red eyes with
sunglasses than to get those wailing damned souls to piss off
for a few minutes! The difficulty of such attempts is generally
5 + the value of your Uncanny Flaw; if, for instance, the clever
bioconstruct Victoria Carliotti gets two points in Uncanny for
her too-perfect skin, rippling muscles, and impossibly green eyes,
her concealment difficulty would be 7. That said, this Flaw does
not increase the difficulty of social rolls and may, depending
on what you’re trying to do, decrease such difficulties instead
(Storyteller’s option).
Despite the potentially grotesque nature of this Flaw,
your uncanniness doesn’t necessarily have to mean that your
physical features are fearsome in themselves. An inhumanly
gorgeous or disturbingly ordinary person can be Uncanny in
their own ways. This Flaw makes an excellent companion to
a variety of Physical Merits and Flaws – Enchanting Feature,
Hyperflexible, Hideous, and so forth – and fits in with Backgrounds like Legend, Past Life or Totem quite well too. (See
the appropriate entries for details.)
Although the Flaw: Echoes can manifest similar odd
phenomena, this Flaw reflects a constant and recognizable
distinction. While it probably embodies certain elements of
your metaphysical practices, it’s not tied to your Resonance or
activities – it’s an innate part of who you are. Your uncanniness
could represent physical features (hulking physique, metallic
skin, eyes that reflect eternity, and so forth); metaphysical
quirks (an unearthly aura, echoing disembodied voices, a
chilling radius around you, etc.); weird companions (a parade
of pink-winged kittens, smoldering butterflies, howling coyote
spirits, or similar inexplicable critters). Essentially, any sort of
localized kink in normalcy’s tail could be considered a sign of
your Uncanny nature. By “uncanny,” incidentally, we don’t
necessarily mean “supernatural.” The unnatural stillness of a
Black Suit, the flawless skin of a Victor, the predatory charisma
of a Syndicate “magic man” – they’re all examples of uncannily
Enlightened technology.
Vulnerability (1 to 7 pt. Flaw)
Some perilous substance may spell your doom. Thanks to
a paranormal weakness – a curse, a Paradox Flaw, a quirk of
belief or cultural legends – you suffer extraordinary harm from
that malignant material. Perhaps you shrivel up in sunlight,
flee from the scent of roses, or melt when obnoxious farm
girls throw water in your face. This substance isn’t generally
fatal to most folks (Awakened or otherwise), but it’s potential
death for you.
Your vulnerability to this substance in question has two
potential levels:
• Weakening, which inflicts one aggravated health level
on your character every turn she’s in contact with the
substance; and…
• Mortal peril, which inflicts three aggravated health levels
for each turn she’s in contact with the substance.
The value of this Flaw is based upon two factors: How
common the fatal substance is, and how badly it affects you:
• (2 points) You can be mortally wounded by contact
with something that’s almost impossible to acquire (the
sound of Pan’s pipes, a splinter from the True Cross),
or weakened by a very rare substance (a chunk of moon
rock, the tooth from an aged lion).
• (3 points) Mortal injury from a very rare substance, or
weakness caused by something that’s relatively scarce
and not obviously harmful (saffron, grave dirt, a raven’s
feathers).Chapter One: Heroic Traits 87
• (4 points) Mortal injury from something that’s relatively
scarce, or weakness from a common substance (rainwater,
silver, a baby’s cry).
• (5 points) A common substance inflicts mortal injury
on you.
• (+1 point) You die instantly upon contact with the
substance in question.
• (+1 point) The mere presence of the substance means
instant death to you.
• (-1 point) The substance must first inflict damage on
you through a typical injury (a stab wound, ingested
poison, a silver bullet) before it can harm you.
Damage from this Flaw cannot be soaked unless you’re
wearing an appropriate type of armor to prevent exposure
to that substance. (Being aggravated damage, it shouldn’t
normally be soaked anyhow, but mages have ways of getting
around such trivialities.) Your backstory should feature the
reason for your potentially fatal vulnerability to this substance.
That vulnerability ought to be tied into your magickal focus,
too – an Alpha Male tycoon isn’t likely to burn upon contact
with holy water, although it might be fun to fling a few dashes
of the stuff around Wall Street and find out for sure! (That
would certainly explain a few things.)
Bizarre Hunger (2 to 5 pt. Flaw)
You prefer – maybe even need – to eat weird shit… quite
possibly in a literal sense of that expression. Perhaps you’ve
sworn a vow, suffered a curse, been treated (or created) with
unhallowed rituals or arcane hyperscience, or initiated into
an occult fellowship with… interesting admission demands. In
any case, you must consume substances that may be degrading,
unpleasant, expensive, or downright illegal.
The more inconvenient the substance, the more this Flaw
is worth:
• (2 points) Easy to procure, though not as easy to devour
(paper, fresh eggs, poop, etc.).
• (3 points) Unpleasant, hazardous, and perhaps illegal
to consume (rotten meat, swamp water, raw cannabis,
and so forth).
• (4 points) Specialized, foul, criminal, and /or expensive
chow (human blood, custom-brewed potions or meals,
and the like).
• (5 points) You really shouldn’t eat such things… but
you must (live humans, toxic sludge, gold dust, highly
specialized food-like concoctions, and other similar
forms of sustenance).
For each dot in your Stamina Trait, you can go one day
without satisfying your special dietary requirements. After that,
you lose one health level per day until you either consume
your particular substance, or else die of hunger or thirst, suffer the punishment of a vow unfulfilled, or otherwise endure
whichever other consequences might result from denying your
bizarre hunger.
For a related (and probably essential) companion Trait,
see the physical Merit: Cast-Iron Stomach, p. 36. And for a
potentially related focus-instrument, see the Chapter Three
Expanded Instruments entry for Cannibalism, pp. 206-207.
Blood-Hungry Soul (2, 3 or 5 pt. Flaw)
In a previous incarnation, you had been a ghoul in thrall
to an unholy addiction to vampiric blood. Now, you must
resist the call of that ravenous past life and its fixation on
intoxicating Kindred vitae.
The deeper your thirst for this damning fulfillment, the
more this Flaw is worth:
• (2 points) You recall the glorious temptations of the
blood, but remember it like a poor choice from long
ago. If the opportunity presents itself to you, however,
you’ll need to make a Willpower roll (difficulty 5) in
order to resist the urge to pursue that addiction again. If
you succumb to that temptation again in this life, your
difficulty to resist further temptations rises to 6 every
time the chance to consume such blood arises again.
• (3 points) That temptation is stronger. Now the roll to
resist that first taste is 6, and the roll to resist further
crimson snacks becomes 8.
• (5 points) You’ve got it bad. Really bad! Obsessed with
the memories of glorious mystic blood, you must beat
difficulty 8 in order to resist your old habits, and difficulty 10 each time you try to deny that thirst after you’ve
fallen back to that damned addiction again.
This is so not going to end well… See the sidebar Mages,
the Blood Bond, and the Effects of Vitae, p. 76, for the longterm effects of such fatal addictions.
Crucial Component (2 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Your metaphysical practice demands specialized instruments. It’s not simply that you need fuel for your hypermodded
Porsche 911 Turbo S – you need your own specially prepared
blend of fuels, or the car won’t go. A simple rowan wand will
not suffice – your spells demand a hand-carved branch cut from
an unscarred rowan tree at high midnight on Samhain Eve. In
game terms, at least one of the instruments in your magickal
focus must be specifically created, harvested or modified to
work with your magicks. No lesser tool will suffice.
How hard is it to procure or employ this specialized component? That depends on the value of the Flaw:
• (2 points) Easy to procure and /or employ (sunlight,
yoga postures, motor oil, strong emotions, a book88 The Book of Secrets
commonly found in the New Age section at your local
bookstore, etc.).
• (3 points) Challenging to procure, employ, or replace
(open flames, the Kurmasana posture, professional
racing oil, genuine sorrow, an out-of-print occult text,
and so on).
• (4 points) Pretty damned hard to obtain, employ, and
replace (liquid fire, the Vrschikasana pose, alchemically
formulated oil, deep-core grief, a genuine Roman text
of De Daemonum Socrates by Apuleius, and other rare
and precious instruments).
• (5 points) Unique, obscure, forbidden, cumbersome, or
some combination of those four (a bottle of alchemically
distilled sunfire, an impossibly complex yoga posture
invented by the practitioner, personally formulated and
distilled hypertech lubricating oil, the heartfelt scream
of a grieving mother, a woodcut-illustrated Renaissance
Grimoire of Honorius inscribed on flayed human skin,
and similarly rarified instruments).
When used, the chosen instrument functions as a Personalized Instrument (Mage 20, pp. 503 and 587) – possibly a
Unique Personalizedone in the case of a five-point component.
In your case, however, you cannot employ the magick that’s
connected to that instrument at all unless you’re also able to
employ that particular instrument. If Lee Ann Milner depends
upon a unique vengeful centipede yoga posture in order to
employ certain Forces Effects through her yoga practice, then
Lee Ann is SOL unless she can assume that posture in time
to deploy the necessary Effects.
In the original version of this Flaw, the material was bound
to a specific Sphere Effect. This revised version ties the Crucial
Component to a tool you employ. This change makes it easier
to keep track of the component and its uses, employing the
new focus rules presented in Mage 20, Chapter Ten, so that
the Flaw becomes an integral part of the way your mage performs magickal Effects. For details about Assigning Practices
and Instruments to Effects, see the section of that name in
Chapter Three, p. 169.
Faulty Enhancements (2 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Well, crap. The warranty on your cybernetic gear has
expired (assuming, of course, that it ever had such assurances
in the first place), and now you’re stuck with malfunctioning
hardware that has literally gotten under your skin. Does your
BCI keep crashing? Do your legs keep seizing up? Is your bioware
constantly trying to eject your iron? Whatever the problem might
be, this Flaw gets rated by the amount of misery it causes you:
• (2 points) You suffer constant disorientation and pain.
• (3 points) The malfunctions keep you in such severe
discomfort that you need to take specialized medication,
or employ other forms of pain relief, at least once a day.
Failure to do so costs you one die from all dice pools
until the problem is rectified.
• (4 points) Your Enhancements fail you at critical times
(generally on a botched roll), crash or freeze up, and
must then be repaired by a technician who understands
the gear you’ve got.
• (5 points) That shitty gear consistently conks out when
you need it most. Roll one die against difficulty 7
whenever you employ cybertech in some important way
(lifting heavy things with bionic arms, sensor-scanning
for enemies, deflecting incoming enemy spells, and so
forth). If you succeed, then the Enhancements function
normally; if you fail, they fail and must be rebooted; if
you botch, they lock up or shut down until a skilled
technician manages to repair them.
Obviously, this Flaw means nothing unless you’ve got the
Background:Enhancements. Although such glitches occur with
Technocratic bioware, they’re far more common in cybernetics
that have been installed by factions whose people haven’t maintained a systemic and standardized approach to human upgrades
for the last few centuries. Wonky Etherites and overambitious
Virtual Adepts invent crappy iron all the time, and so this Flaw
is especially appropriate for cyborgs from those zealously individualistic Traditions, as well as for ex-Technocrats who’ve managed
to go rogue and survive the experience thus far.
Jinx /Infernal Contraption (2 to 10 pt. Flaw)
Stormbringer. The One Ring. The Monkey’s Paw. Sure,
that paranormal doohickey may possess amazing powers, but
it’s also a sack of miseries the likes of which few humans can
imagine. And you’ve got one. Lucky you…
As with the Background: Wonder (a Trait for which this
Flaw was once an adversarial Background), this Trait reflects
an uncanny item or device. In this case, however, the “treasure”
is more trouble than it’s worth. Perhaps it’s cursed with misfortunes, poorly made, haunted by malignant spirits, seething
with Paradox emanations, or too experimental for its own
good. It could be the earthly form of an unpleasant entity (“I
was a thousand times eviler than thou…”), an alien artifact, or the
remnant of a culture that passed into dust millennia ago – and
good riddance to them! Or maybe it’s simply a truly wondrous
treasure that dislikes you personally, like the Sword of Fighting
in JourneyQuest. For whatever the reason might be, you own
this mystic /hypertech millstone, and can’t easily get rid of it.
Like all variable-point Flaws, the value of this Trait depends
upon its ability to screw up your life. In this case, however, the
value of the Flaw is deducted from the Background cost of a
Wonder. In order to avoid nightmarish catastrophes of math,
every two points in the Flaw are worth one dot in the Wonder
Background’s cost. That cost, however, cannot drop below one
dot (two points), and so any points that get “left over” betweenChapter One: Heroic Traits 89
the value of the Flaw and the two points in that Wonder are
added to the owner’s character sheet, reflecting the proverbial
dead albatross around the character’s neck: a mighty burden
he can’t just toss away.
For expanded rules regarding Wonders, see the section of
that name in Chapter Two, pp. 139-165.
• (2 points) Your Jinxed item features an annoying
drawback that, while not deadly, makes life
difficult for the person who owns it. Examples:
it attracts ghosts, smells bad, makes irritating
sounds at inconvenient times, or radiates a
pervasive aura of discomfort.
•• (4 points) The Jinxed item has several annoying
drawbacks (as above), or perhaps one or two
problematic ones.Examples: It must shed blood
each time it’s employed, has a contentious
and unpleasant personality, attracts malignant
spirits, or tempts the owner to violate her moral
code.
••• (6 points) Your item features a host of annoying
drawbacks (at least six of them), three or four
problematic ones, and /or a major flaw. Examples: The item belongs a powerful paranormal
entity that wants it back, it inflicts constant
pain on whomever uses it (three bashing health
levels per turn of operation), the object radiates
an aura of corruption and decay, or it steadily
drives its owner toward atrocities.
•••• (8 points) In addition to at least six annoying
drawbacks and /or five problematic ones, plus
two or more major flaws, the item also backfires
if you fail a roll of Wits + Esoterica (or Wits
+ Hypertech, if the item employs advanced
technology), against difficulty 7. The Storyteller
is encouraged to get creative when deciding
how that backfire manifests; for suggestions,
see the Mucking About with Wonders chart,
Chapter Two, p. 141.
•••••• (10 points) In addition to the previous level of
difficulty, the Storyteller essentially has an open
license to make your life difficult in unexpected,
creative, and often mysterious ways. Examples:
A bloodthirsty cult that’s after the treasure, a
demonic entity imprisoned within the item, a
cross-dimensional vortex of probability fluxes
and quirks of physics that manifest in the
object’s vicinity, and so forth.
These flaws, of course, should be based in the nature of the
Jinxed item and its relationship to the owner. That said, there’s
no reason that a robot can’t be possessed by evil spirits or a
primeval artifact can’t be a technological hazard using unknown
technology. Stranger things, in Mage, happen all the time.
Permanent Paradox Flaw
(2, 4 or 6 pt. Flaw)
Following a nasty brush with Paradox, you’re got a Flaw
that just won’t go away. System-wise, select a trivial (two points),
minor (four points), or significant (six points) Paradox Flaw as
described on Mage 20, p. 551. That Flaw is now part of your
character’s life until you buy off this Flaw, preferably with experience earned through some extraordinary adventure that’s
related to the Paradox Flaw in question and the mishap that
created that Flaw in the first place.
Branded (3 to 5 pt. Flaw)
You’ve been found guilty by a Traditions Tribunal, who
Branded your Avatar with a sigil that indicates your crime. Folks
who can see that sigil recognize that you’re a criminal of some
sort, and the worse the Brand, the more severe your crime and
the more appropriate their reaction will be. Those reactions
won’t always be negative; considering the sort of people who’d
be favorably inclined toward a known criminal, though, do you
really want the goodwill of such people?
• (3 points) A temporary Brand for a Low Crime (see
below), which fades after one to three months. At the
end of that period, this Flaw goes away. This Brand raises
the difficulty of your social rolls by +1 for “average”
Tradition mages and +2 for especially law-biding ones.
• (4 points) A lasting Brand for a Low Crime. This Brand
lasts for a year or more, and marks you as a rather
notorious offender. The difficulty of your social rolls
rises by +2 among most mages who can recognize the
Brand’s significance, and +3 among mages who take
such offenses and punishments seriously.
• (5 points) A lasting Brand for a High Crime, which will
not fade for at least nine years and may be essentially
permanent. The Brand raises the difficulty of your social rolls by +3 for any character who cares at all about
Tradition justice and the people who incur its punishment. Certain parties will target you for additional
punishment, and others will consider you to be prime
meat for their recruiting efforts.
For details about Tradition crimes and punishments, see
Chapter Four’s entries regarding Crimes and Punishments in
the section Among the Traditions, pp. 213-219.
Demented Eidolon (3 pt. Flaw)
There’s someone in your head, and it’s not you. Despite
your commitment to logic and reason, a mad heretic rants
through the inside of your skull, insisting that what you do
is magick, not science. This rough voice drives you toward Superstitionism and Reality Deviance. Not that you would ever
consider such insanity. No, really – seriously, never.90 The Book of Secrets
A Flaw for Technocratic operatives and other technomancers who refuse to view what they do as “magic,” this
Trait pits your conscious-self against an Avatar hell-bent on
reclaiming the identity of mage. The Eidolon (Technocrat-ese
for Essence) invested within your Genius (Avatar) whips that
paragon of Enlightenment into Deviant directions. While most
Technocratic Geniuses behave themselves for the most part,
this one assumes a flagrantly supernatural mien and batters at
the fortress of Reason (and Social Processing) that protects you
from Deviant thoughts. It may even be entertaining to have a
different player assume the role of your Genius, especially during
a Seek… I mean, during one of those meditative interludes
which allow you to process the enigmas of Enlightenment.
Ideally, this Flaw compliments a Genius (Avatar) Trait rated
at 3 or higher, and it goes well (from a “dramatic roleplaying”
standpoint, anyway!) with Backgrounds likePast Lives,Destiny,
andLegend, Merits likeTwin SoulandAvatar Companion, and
Flaws like Throwback, and – as one may imagine – Dark Fate.
Haunted (3 pt. Flaw)
An angry ghost – perhaps even more than one of them – has
an entire skeleton to pick with you. Did you kill her yourself,
or does she blame you for her death? Did you commit some
awful crime against her during her living days, or were you
foolish enough to attempt (and perhaps succeed at) a bitter act
of necromancy against her after she had died? Whatever your
sin might be (and whether or not you actually did anything
wrong in the first place), this wraith is determined to make
you suffer for whatever remains of your own life… and possibly
your afterlife too, if she can manage that!
Check outWraith: The Oblivionto learn more about ghosts
and the various powers they can employ to harass the living. If
your group doesn’t include Wraith rules or characters in your
chronicle, your Storyteller can simply unload on you with the
many phantasmal abilities mentioned in haunting lore: rattling
chains, chilling voices, sudden drops in temperature, and so forth.
Primal Marks (3 pt. Flaw)
You’ve been marked by some god, spirit, myth, or other
metaphysical entity… and the mark is not a pleasant one.
Maybe you share Papa Ghede’s nasal voice and crude sense of
humor, or Coyote’s grotesquely huge cock, or Christ’s bleeding
stigmata. Essentially, this Flaw is the flipside of the Merit:
Mark of Favor; in your case, though, the mark complicates
your life, twists your body, and alerts people who understand
the significance of that mark. In certain circles – say, being
marked by Satan while living in a deeply religious region –
a Primal Mark can be a life-threatening affair. Such marks
can also indicate the profound displeasure of the entity in
question, like the Mark of Cain (in a non-vampiric sense,
anyway) which set the First Murderer apart while sparing his
life for a long-enduring punishment. But even if the entity in
question likes you, this particular mark is more of a burden
than a blessing. If, for instance, you stink like a goat and have
the heavy, hairy features of Pan, that’s not going to make
you terribly popular with the ladies… especially not if you’re
female to begin with!
This disconcerting legacy might come through as animalistic features that reveal your connection to a totem spirit, as
described in the Totem Background entry and the appropriate
section of Mage 20’s Appendix I. (See pp. 326-328 and 633-
636.) Or the “mark” might involve some physical manifestation
of your inner Avatar. You could share the archetypal “look” of
a notorious family, like the Borgias or Romanovs, even if you’re
not actually related to that bloodline; or bear an uncanny resemblance to some sinister beast even if you’re not a shapechanger
or totem-friend. Maybe you just look like what people think
of when they say wizard, shaman, or witch – which, in many
cultures, can be rather unhealthy for people so identified. In
short, you look weird in the literal, uncanny meaning of that
phrase, and people notice.
Obviously, you should define the appearance of this feature,
and decide the sort of reaction people have when they notice
it. Because this is a Flaw, of course, that reaction should be
negative in some way – the “primal mark of the Jolie-Pitt Clan”
is not exactly a Flaw unless you’re dealing with paparazzi. The
“mark” could also be a tone of voice, a distinct way of moving
(birdlike, catlike, Papa Legba-like), or a certain vibe that nearly
anyone can sense. Whatever their source and manifestation,
these Primal Marks are obvious, and they tend to carry over
even when a mage changes shape. People recognize you even
when you’d rather not be recognized, and that sort of distinction
can be rather unhealthy too.
This Flaw goes well with Backgrounds like Blessing,
Destiny, Legend, Past Lives, and, as suggested earlier, Totem.
It could be taken as a genetic Flaw for Enhancements, or as
a reflection of an especially potent Avatar. For extra fun, you
might not even know why you’ve been so marked, who marked
you, or what may come as a result of the mark. As with so
many elements of a mage’s life, these Primal Marks could be
mysteries whose answers lay at the end of a long and winding
Path… if, indeed, those answers ever reveal themselves at all.
Oathbreaker (4 pt. Flaw)
Sworn oaths are powerful things, especially when magick
is involved. And yet, you have broken your vow – not a simple
promise, but an oath of serious significance. “I’m sorry” won’t
cut it here; you need serious atonement in order to make
things right, and until that point, anyone who can read auras
or listen to gossip within the proper circles will know you for
the faithless swine you are.
A story-based Flaw, Oathbreaker marks your character out
as someone who is not to be trusted. People who place great
value in honor will shun her, and others will exploit what they
consider her generally dishonorable nature. Beyond that, other
characters may be hunting her, with the intention of exacting
penance or revenge… maybe both! Resonance, Paradox, Seekings, and Quiet will reflect the metaphysical dimensions of thisChapter One: Heroic Traits 91
broken vow. Your Seekings may involve literal guilt-trips in which
you’re confronted with the potential (or real) consequences of
your violated promise; your Resonance remains tainted by the
presence of dishonor; Paradox will assume appropriately ironic
forms, like visitations from the entity called Judgment in Mage
20, Appendix I; and should you fall into Quiet, there’ll be no
place to hide from the transgression you’ve committed. In short,
then, you’re screwed for reasons that are very likely your own fault.
(Tragic stories, of course, revolve around people who
broke vows without meaning to do so, or who were put into
no-win situations regarding promises that could not possibly
have been kept. The universe, however, can be implacable and
uncaring in such matters. “Fair,” among Awakened folk, is not
a common word!)
Some sort of penance should be available to an oath-breaking character. She might not know what that atonement is,
though, and the quest for such rectification could be the seed
for powerful stories (cf. the tragedy ofOedipus Rex). Atonement is
rarely a pleasant matter (again, see Oedipus), but the successful
performance of such rituals should erase this Flaw… at least
until you make and break another promise, that is.
For a related Flaw, see Faithless, below. To see potential
consequences of oath-breaking, check out the genre entry for
Tragedy in Chapter Five’s section Genre, Storytelling, and
Mage, pp. 285-286.
Prone to Quiet (4 to 5 pt. Flaw)
In an effort to avert the inevitable stresses of Awakened
life, you tend to drop into metaphysical Quiets (as per Mage
20, pp. 554-561) more easily than most other mages do. The
easier you fall into them, the more this Flaw is worth:
• (4 points) Quiet is your default Paradox backlash, and
so a backlash of five points or more automatically sends
you into Quiet.
• (5 points) Quiet is your default backlash, and you
can fall into it even without a Paradox discharge.
Roll your Intelligence + Enigmas dice pool when
you’re faced with an unusually stressful situation;
if you succeed, then you’re able to puzzle your way
out of the fall – and if not, well, then, welcome back
to Quietville… (The roll’s difficulty ranges from 6
to 10, depending upon the severity of the stress and
whether or not you’ve dealt with this particular kind
of stress before.)
Although it’s most often noticed in Virtual Adepts and
other Netizens, who tend to set off into the Digital Web in
order to escape physical unpleasantness, any mage can suffer
from this Flaw.92 The Book of Secrets
Beast Within (5 pt. Flaw)
You’ve got a truly infernal temper: one so violent it feels
like a volcano in your soul. As with a werewolf or vampire,
you’re subject to the dreaded frenzy that turns you into an
engine of hot rage. Under intense stress, you risk losing every
shred of enlightenment you possess. Driven to such extremity,
you let loose with the most immediately destructive powers at
your command, and “vulgarity” be damned! Everyone in your
vicinity becomes a target, and the consequences matter to you
only when this inner storm has passed.
System-wise, this Flaw sends you into deadly rages as per the
Berserker /Stress Atavism Trait featured in Mage 20, p. 644.
Instead of rolling your Willpower to avoid the frenzy, however,
you roll your Avatar rating plus one die, with your Willpower
as the difficulty of that roll. If, as an example, young Vyper
Trabia suffers from the Beast Within Flaw, with an Avatar of
4 and a Willpower of 5, Vyper’s player rolls five dice against a
difficulty of 5 when that Akashic hothead is under ferocious
stress. A failure on that roll sends Vyper into a berserk rage.
Yeah, this probably happens pretty often. Vyper’s friends don’t
stick around for long when things go poorly.
(If you employ the optional Resonance Trait described in
Chapter Two, you could substitute your highest Resonance,
plus one die, as the dice pool for your rage. The roll’s difficulty
is still your Willpower Trait, and your Resonance plus that extra
die should at least equal, if not exceed, your Avatar Trait. In
this case, the Resonance in question must be something capriciously unstable – Wild, Primal, Ferocious, and so forth – instead
of calm and centered energy. For details, see Four Flavors of
Resonance, pp. 136-138.)
Considering that the Avatar could be seen as your inner
Beast, a character with the Pattern Essence cannot take this
Flaw. It’s best suited for Dynamic Essences, although a Questing or Primordial Avatar could attain frightening rages too.
A berserk mage cannot employ rituals or employ complicated
tools; only the most direct methods of attack – magickal or
otherwise – will do. Although mages rarely suffer from such
grotesque lapses of self-control, an Awakened Ghoul (as in
that Merit), a cyborg, a Victor, a Shapechanger Kin (again, as
per the Merit), or an animalistic shape-changer could possess
such inhuman monstrousness.
For similarly bestial character traits, see the Mental Flaw:
Feral Mind (p. 52) and the Expanded Practice of Animalism
in Chapter Three, pp. 197-199.
Blood Magick (5 pt. Flaw)
Your Arts demand blood… specifically,your ownblood. And
while many practices employ small amounts of ritual cutting
or bloodletting, this degree of sacrifice demands an injurious
amount of vital fluid each time you cast a spell.
With this Flaw (mislabeled as a Merit in the sourcebook
Sorcerer, Revised Edition), you must suffer one unsoakable
health level in bashing damage whenever you employ an Effect. Story-wise, you cut yourself, slash designs in your skin, or
otherwise hurt yourself enough to shed the required amount
of blood. This sort of thing can, of course, add up quickly if
you’re throwing lots of magick around without giving yourself a
chance to heal, as bashing damage soon leads to lethal damage
(see Types of Injury in Mage 20, p. 406). Meanwhile, your
bloodletting looks pretty gross and obvious (often vulgarly
so), and tends to make a mess as well. Your companions might
appreciate the results of your magick, but may well object to
the methods you employ… especially since blood magick has a
rather unsavory rep among all but the most primal of practices.
Bound (5 pt. Flaw)
Mentor always told you not to make bargains with strange
entities. But did you listen?Nope. Now you’re in deep to someone
whose power dwarfs your own, and your prospects for getting
out of bondage are laughable at best. Haunted by thoughts of
the payment to come, you live on borrowed time and realize
that the worst is yet to come…
Sometimes known, with minor variations, as Faust’s
Bargain, Bound puts your character in the Faust-like position
of getting something interesting in return for something significant – her life, her soul, a thousand years of servitude, or a
similarly awful fate that no one in their right mind would want
to risk. Still, occultists are infamous for short-term thinking,
and literal devil’s deals are common currency in the magickal
world. The specifics of that deal are for you and your Storyteller to arrange; you might have received some Merit(s) and /
or Abilities in return for the debt (purchased with the points
from this Flaw), escaped an awful situation (“You want out of this
death-trap, dear wizard? Very well – what do you have to offer me?”),
saved someone who was important to you (“Sure, I’ll bring your
mother back from the brink of death – let us discuss the terms of this
favor…”), or otherwise blew a standoff with an Otherworldly
entity (see theSummoning, Binding, Bargaining, and Warding
section of How Do You DO That? pp. 91-95).
Like the Flaw: Dark Fate (below), this debt throws a foreboding air over your character’s part of the chronicle. In this
case, though, your doom may be averted if you can wrangle a
way out of this pact. In the meantime, your creditor will call
in occasional favors – nothing large enough to pay off the debt
(unless that entity needs a significant service and agrees to
write off the larger obligation), but deeds that can spark new
stories or complicate existing ones. Despite tradition, this debt
doesn’t have to be a soul-pact owed to a devil – a promise to
your god(s) or their immediate emissaries can be just as terrible
as one owed to Old Scratch!
Dark Fate (5 pt. Supernatural Flaw)
You’re screwed. No matter what you do, regardless of your
heroic deeds (possibly because of them), there’s a terrible end
in your not-too-distant future. Prophecies speak of it, visions
remind you of it, and other folks seem to know it too. You
realize this fact, and it weighs upon you. From time to time,Chapter One: Heroic Traits 93
you must spend a Willpower point in order to shrug aside the
dread of your impending damnation; otherwise, you lose one
die from all rolls for the rest of that day. A common Flaw for
Nephandi, Infernalists, and other folks who don’t know when
to stop fucking with Forces That Should Not Be Fuck’d With,
this Dark Fate becomes Damocles’ sword in your Storyteller’s
hands. Sleep well… while you can. (Once again, check out the
Chapter Five genre entry for Tragedy.)
Faithless (5 pt. Flaw)
Magick, according to your beliefs, does not come from
you – it comes from your god, and you’ve broken faith
with him. Until you can shake this crisis of faith, perhaps
atoning for your perceived misdeeds, your Spheres remain
stuck at Rank 1 – potent enough to perceive the presence
of Divinity around you, limited enough to remind you that
you have failed.
This Flaw (which is more likely to be “awarded” to you
through the course of the game than it is to be something
you purchased during character creation, though of course
you can start off a new character in such a crisis) represents
the power of faith in your character’s life – a power so strong
that it can interfere with your abilities as a mage. Ironically,
the strength of that faith denies you the ability to use magick
when you feel that your faith is lacking. From a game-system
standpoint, you are denying yourself the ability to access your
magick because you believe that your magick comes from a
source you have betrayed. Your mage believes that his god is
cutting him off from magick, though… and, considering that
the player is pretty much the “god” of a gaming character, in
a meta sort of way, that’s true.
Although a character with this Flaw can pursue any sort of spiritual focus, his paradigm and practicemustbe oriented toward religious
devotion. You could be a shaman or a priest, a Goddess-bound witch,
a spiritual scientist, even an Infernalist whose hell-spawned powers
flow from a damnation pact. Obviously, this Flaw means nothing
to an atheist, or to someone with nebulously casual beliefs. Only
a mage who believes deeply in some greater power can believe that
she has so much to lose from a sudden lack of faith.
In order to discard this Flaw, the player must pay a fivepoint “fine” in order to buy off the Trait itself, and roleplay
out a “dark night of the soul” sort of Seeking in which he
faces his sins and rededicates himself to his divine Path.
The character, meanwhile, must first undergo an atonement
that suits his belief system and the “sin” that invoked this
punishment. Maybe he needs to take strict vows within a religious order… or take on even stricter ones if he had already
broken his previous set of vows. Did he violate a taboo? Then
he must undergo ritual purification, often by way of fasting,
marathons of prayer, and some traditionally torturous ordeals.
A mage who has sworn never to kill, and yet who has killed
someone, may be forced to make significant restitutions to
the murdered person’s family. Traditional atonements include pilgrimages, vision quests, oaths of poverty, appalling
mortifications (self-torture, radical fasting, mutilation, and so
forth), and other difficult paths back to the favor of one’s god.
Regardless of the creed and specific atonements, however, the
mage must spend endless hours in intensive prayer. A faithless
soul, after all, must find his way back to the presence of his
god… typically on his knees.
Immortal Enemy (5 to 8 pt. Flaw)
Oh, dear. You’ve pissed off someone whose concept of
“eternal grudge” could be taken literally. Essentially, you’ve got
the Enemy Flaw with a powerful and more or less immortal
entity: a vampire elder, a demon, a demigod, totem spirit, Loa,
dragon, or other being who measures its existence in centuries
or millennia, with resources and abilities to match. Foolish
wizard, what will you do now?
For the relative power of this enemy (or perhaps for the
number of your enemies), see the Merit: Powerful Ally, p. 77.
Psychic Vampire (5 pt. Flaw)
Also known as the Reaper’s Touch, this dreadful curse
makes you a life-force siphon. Your presence consumes vitality
from your surroundings and the living things who happen to
get too close to you. Unless you do so, however, your own lifeforce withers. Despite your best intentions, you’re essentially
a walking void into which life itself pours in order to sustain
your own existence.
Story-wise, you’re a drain on the energy of your companions. Insects and small plants perish in your presence, while
children and animals smaller than a horse feel ill when you
stand near them. System-wise, any character who’s in physical
contact with you for an hour or more loses one health level per
hour to bashing damage. If you’re unable to soak up someone
else’s life-force, though, then your own vitality drains away. In
system terms, you lose health levels in the reverse order that
you would heal lethal damage, dropping to Bruised after one
day, to Hurt after three days, to Injured after one week, and
so on. (For details, see Mage 20, p. 406.)
If you employ Life Sphere magicks, your difficulties for
healing or improvement-type Effects are raised by +2, while
your difficulties with corrupting, damage, or illness-related
Effects are lowered by -2. (In both cases, the usual maximums
and minimums still apply.) Each health level you inflict on
someone else with Life Sphere magick heals you of one health
level if you’re injured, or else forestalls the “starvation” loss of
your own health levels by one day per health level inflicted.
An inversion of the Merit: Spark of Life (p. 78), this Flaw
darkens your aura, makes your blood taste awful as far as vampires
are concerned, and keeps your close associates constantly sick
with low-level ailments. Life-affirming mages consider this to
be a mark of profound misfortune or outright evil, while folks
who love corruption (Nephandi and the like) see you as a ripe
candidate for recruitment. Mundane science can’t do a damn
thing about this metaphysical malady, and dismisses such fluffy
concepts as “life-force energies.” The Technocratic Union, on the94 The Book of Secrets
other hand, takes this sort of thing seriously, and tends to view
psychic vampires as Reality Deviants of the most unfortunate kind.
For a potentially related metaphysical application of this
Flaw, see the Chapter Three Expanded Instruments entry
Cannibalism, pp. 206-207.
Bedeviled (6 pt. Flaw)
Oh, you poor bastard! A mysterious power has decided to
fuck with you, and it’s perfectly capable of making your life a
chronicle of woe. Misery and setbacks are your bread and butter;
should things start looking up for you, you begin looking up
as well to spot the inevitable anvil dropping toward your head.
This sort of thing goes way beyond simple misfortune or even
a paltry little curse. Your enigmatic foe is a dedicated cuss, and
whatever it might be (it’s not necessarily an actual devil, though
it certainly seems like one to you!), that force has apparently
unlimited resources and a very sick sense of humor; in short,
then, it’s your typical Storyteller.
A story-based Flaw, this wretched Trait essentially grants
the Storyteller a license to give your character the starring
role in a twenty-first-century Book of Job. (And again, check
out Tragedy.) There ought to be a certain rhyme and reason
behind this metaphysical fuckery, of course, but the source of
your agonies, and the way you could potentially end them, are
for your Storyteller to know and you to find out… should you
be fortunate enough to live so long.
Sphere Inept (6 pt. Flaw)
A particular element of Reality eludes you. No matter
how devoted you might be to mastering its complexities,
this field of magick remains a challenge. Essentially, this is
the reverse of the Merit: Sphere Natural, described above;
one Sphere costs 130% more (rounded up) to learn than the
other Spheres cost.
Rank Cost /Affinity Sphere Cost
New Sphere 13 pts
2 11 /9 pts.
3 21 /19 pts.
4 32 /28 pts.
5 42 /37 pts.
Again, this Flaw can apply to only one Sphere (fortunately!),
and comes through in your practice and backstory. Someone
who’s inept at understanding, say, Time will have a very wonky
relationship with schedules and timing.
Phylactery (7 pt. Flaw)
Your magick, perhaps your very soul, resides outside of your
physical self. Maybe you’ve placed your soul within a ring, a jar,
or a wooden doll in order to protect yourself from possession and
control. Or perhaps you believe that your wand, not your Will,Chapter One: Heroic Traits 95
is the source of your mystic powers. You could have built a robot
as an extension of your Genius, or crafted a jacket into which
you’ve instilled the very essence of who you are. The receptacle
itself is not important except with regards to its portability. This
Flaw reflects the fact that you must have the receptacle before you
can employ your Arts. Without it, you’re just another Sleeper.
Linguistically, phylactery comes from a Greek root meaning
“to guard.” In many forms of classical magick, practitioners
would place their souls or life-force within amulets, either as
protection for their souls or as portable vessels for spellwork.
Orthodox Jews sometimes employ tefillin – often referred to as
phylacteries – as reminders of their covenant with God. As a
Mage Trait, your Phylactery serves as a container for the “inner
god” that allows a mage to change reality: the Awakened Avatar.
How your character views this relationship between the
container, his Awakened self, and the ability to perform magick
depends on the character’s paradigm. A Slavic witch could believe
that she has taken her heart and placed it into a hardboiled egg;
a mad scientist may use consciousness-transposing co-location
theory in order to secure his brilliance in a vat-held brain. The
shapechanging shaman invests her soul into a wolf-skin, while
a Hermetic magus employs Roman rituals to lock his immortal
essence into a golden staff. Your phylactery is probably an item,
but it could conceivably be a location (a grove, a garden, a house,
etc.) or living being (a child, a bird, a tree, a manufactured intelligence housed within a mainframe, and so forth). The key is
this: Your mage must be able to physically access the phylactery in order
to employ Sphere magick. And therein lays the Flaw.
All told, a phylactery offers a few powerful benefits in exchange for some pretty significant drawbacks. On the plus side:
• A phylactery allows you to preserve a part of your consciousness outside your mortal body. That body may
be destroyed, but your soul and consciousness live on
until or unless the phylactery is destroyed. With Mind
4, you can project that consciousness into another body
or an astral form, while a character with Mind 5 /Spirit
5 can place your Awakened consciousness into a new
body for you.
• If the phylactery is taken from you, or you’re taken away
from it, you can retrieve it, or return to it, with a successful
application of the Correspondence Sphere. The difficulty
for this return Effect is 4 if the return would seem coincidental to a witness, 5 if it’s vulgar without witnesses, and 6
if it’s vulgar with witnesses. (Yes, the usual Paradox applies.)
• A living phylactery retains a psychic bond with you, as if
you’re in constant empathic and telepathic contact with
that character. (No roll necessary.) If the phylactery is a
place, then you retain an awareness of that place, and
can check in with it by using Perception + Awareness,
difficulty 6. (For very large areas, the check-in difficulty
may range from 7 to 10.)
• With the addition of the Merit: “Immortal” at the
seven-point level, your physical body may continue
to survive until the phylactery is destroyed… which, if
you don’t mind going without your magick for a while,
could render you more or less immune to death if
you then hide your phylactery away in a safe location.
Traditionally speaking, that’s why many mages make
phylacteries in the first place: to preserve their mortal
lives indefinitely.
• So long as your phylactery remains safe and undamaged,
you remain immune to Gilgul and other soul-trapping
attacks. Your body may be possessed, but your soul
cannot be stolen or destroyed unless someone attacks
your phylactery instead… in which case you’re screwed,
as described below. For details about Gilgul, see that
entry in Chapter Four, pp. 218-220.
• And if you invest your soul into a place, you literally carry
the essence of that place within yourself, while a part of
you always remains there. For practitioners of certain ancestral forms of magic (or simply for hardcore romantics),
that’s a very powerful reason to do such a thing.
Those are the good points. The downsides are as follows:
• If the phylactery gets destroyed, your ability to use magick
in this life gets destroyed along with it.
• You cannot perform magick or recharge your Avatar
unless you have some form of physical connection to
your phylactery. That form could involve a physical
gateway to virtual contact, as with a computer that
accesses a mainframe, but you still need that gateway
in order to reach a distant phylactery. (Yes, you may use
Correspondence Sphere magick to reach the phylactery,
and you are always counted as being one success away
from your phylactery when you use Correspondence to
reach out to it.)
• If your phylactery is a place, you must be in that place
in order to employ the Spheres. If it’s a living thing,
then that character has got to be within touching range
before you can use the Spheres. (Explains a lot about
Blofeld and his cat, doesn’t it?)
• If you’re using your phylactery to cast magick, you need
to be rather obvious about it – shouting commands to
your hypertech robot pal, holding your mystic crown aloft,
hewing your demonic sword through enemies as you shout
invocations to your patron god, that sort of thing.
• If your Avatar communicates to you through an embodied phylactery character, then you need to purchase the
Merit: Manifest Avatar (p. 71) to represent the Avatar’s
physical form.96 The Book of Secrets
• If your phylactery is an item, then it’s considered aunique
personalized instrument, as per the rules in Mage 20,
pp. 587-588. It can be broken, stolen or repaired, but
cannot be replaced if it’s totally destroyed.
Creating a phylactery of this sort demands high-level magick
– Correspondence 5 /Prime 5 /Spirit 5 /Mind 4 to be exact,
plus Matter 4 to invest one’s self into a material item, Life 5
to invest it into a living thing, and Life 5 /Matter 4 in order
to instill it into a place with an active biosphere – a forest or
lake, as opposed to a bare room or large metal box.
(A previous description of the phylactery investment ritual,
given in the sourcebook Dead Magic, p. 112, stated that only
Spirit 3 was necessary for investment; by the rules, however,
this claim is incorrect. You need Correspondence 5 to forge
so powerful a connection, Prime 5 to invest that intimate a
degree of vital energy, Spirit 5 to bind the Awakened Avatar
spirit into a separate place or being, and Mind 4 to project an
aspect of consciousness out of the body and into a separate
vessel. Spirit 3 alone does none of these things.)
Unless your mage is already a Master of the appropriate
Spheres, this Flaw assumes that some stronger power invested
(or trapped) your Avatar and consciousness into that phylactery
for you. According to some practices, a magical practitioner
must create a phylactery in order to use their most potent Arts;
although that’s not true in the greater scheme of Mage, that
doesn’t mean people don’t still believe that it is.
Taint of Corruption (7 pt. Flaw)
Evil has an intimate hold on you. Your spirit has been
corrupted – possibly since birth, as with the reborn Nephandi
known as widderslainte – and you are, as the werewolves put it,
“of the Wyrm” whether you wish to be or not. This doesn’t
necessarily mean you behave in an evil manner – you can
choose to resist the evil inside you. On a metaphysical level,
however, you bear an innate corruption which tests the ideal
of Enlightened self-determination. You may, perhaps, defeat
it, but it’ll be a hard struggle before you do.
(Need we mention the Tragedy section again? I guess we
just did.)
From a story perspective, this Flaw could come from demonic possession, the aftermath of an awful Quiet or a badly
botched high-level Seeking, corrupt Resonance, one too many
deals with malignant Umbrood, a curse, a vile past life, wicked
karma, Nephandic heritage, poor life-choices, the influence of
the Wyrm, a collection of tainted texts or artifacts, time spent in
a hell, or other forms of metaphysical poison. It almost certainly
shapes your magickal focus, and the things you do in pursuit
of your magicks (that is, your practices and instruments) may
well perpetrate this corruption. (Hey, now, hey now now…) To
entities who recognize such soul-stains, you are either a mortal
enemy (as far as most werewolves are concerned), an object of
pity and potential salvation (the nicer sorts of mages), or – most
likely – both. (“Hey, it’s a mercy killing, right?”)
Meanwhile, inside your skin, you wrestle with the urges
born from that corruption. Whether or not you give in to them
(which would, of course, just deepen the decay), your dreams
and impulses hold a distinctly unpleasant edge. Working malignant magick is frighteningly easy for you (-2 to your difficulties,
up to the usual modifier limits), but your “good” spells are
harder to cast (+2 difficulty, as above) and have a tendency to
leave traces of corruption even when you succeed. Your aura
crackles or swirls with leprous stains, and your Merits, Flaws,
Backgrounds, and other Traits reflect the damnation you carry
inside. A truly epic quest might purge this evil (and buy off
this Flaw), but maybe it’s just easier to go with the flow, even
if that flow leads you straight into the gutter and beyond36 The Book of Secrets
make a Stamina roll (difficulty 7) to shake off the effects of
intoxication – a useful talent for hard-pounding Ecstatics and
tough-as-leather Black Suits!
In its one-point form, this Merit functions only for “natural”
drugs (booze, pot, cocaine, etc.), not for lab-synthesized concoctions
(LSD, meth, krokodil, etc.). For two points, however, the Merit can
neutralize the psychoactive effects of any drug unless that drug has
been created as the vector for a Sphere-based magickal Effect. (That is,
say, a pill that delivers a Life 3 /Mind 3 Effect to the person who
takes it, as opposed to an “ordinary” pill that a mage takes as part
of the focus instruments Drugs and Poisons or Brews, Potions,
and so forth, as detailed in Mage 20, pp. 588-600.) In the latter
case, the character needs to use countermagick; this Merit will not
help to counteract such drugs. “Awakened” substances, however
(as per Mage 20, p. 443) are treated as “synthesized concoctions”
even if they are, in all other forms, “natural.
For a more comprehensive resistance to toxins, see Poison
Resistance, below.
Ambidextrous (1 pt. Merit)
The hemispheres of your brain are so attuned that you can
use both hands with equal dexterity. In game terms, you do not
suffer a higher difficulty if you use two weapons or perform some
task with your off-hand. The normal rules for performing multiple
actions still apply (see Mage 20, p. 388-389), but coordination
between the left and right sides of your body is no problem at all.
Cast-Iron Stomach (1 pt. Merit)
You can eat more or less anything without gagging.
Squirming bugs, synthetic goop, a freshly-gutted carcass with
the innards still hanging out… hey, it’s all food, so chow down!
Anything you can physically devour and digest is yours for
the eating. This Merit does not in any way protect you from
the effects of said substances (rotted meat can still poison
you), but you can keep down a meal that would make the
average person puke from its mere proximity… an especially
useful gift if you have the supernatural Flaw: Bizarre Hunger
(see p. 87).
Catlike Balance (1 pt. Merit)
Your sense of balance has been honed – either through practice, magick, or other means – to uncanny acuity. System-wise,
you reduce the difficulty by -2 when your character performs
some physical act (rolling with a fall, walking a tightrope, etc.)
that requires her to keep her feet.
Hyperflexible (1 pt. Merit)
You are what’s commonly but erroneously known as
“double-jointed” (as per the old Merit of that name). In reality,
your joints are exceedingly flexible, perhaps due to intense
training, magickal augmentation, or the medical condition
known as Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS – see above, as well as
the Impediment Flaw, below). Whatever the reason, you can
stretch and flex in ways most people cannot.
In game terms, this Merit allows you a -2 reduction in
difficulty for rolls that involve physical flexibility – escape
attempts, contortions, etc. Your character can also perform
uncanny acts of hyperflexibility, as seen in Cirque Du Soleil,
butoh dance, and extreme yoga postures.
Light Sleeper (1 pt. Merit)
Four hours of sleep a night works just fine for you. And
unlike most folks, you can wake up out of an apparently
dead slumber more or less ready for action. You can, of
course, enjoy longer periods of sleep too. But when deadlines, intruders, and end-of-the-world emergencies shake
you out of bed, you get by with cat-naps and the occasional
light snooze.
Noble Blood (1 pt. Merit)
Although the modern world resists the old traditions of
lineage as a mark of quality, your features link you to a powerful family; you’re a Kennedy, a Windsor, a Saud, a Rothschild
– someone whose pedigree is obvious in your physical form
and presence.
In story terms, this Merit grants you the obvious physical
features of a well-known “royal” family: the Kennedy smile, the
Windsor ears, and so forth. The family in question doesn’t
have to belong to a formal aristocracy, either; you might be
a Kardashian, a Murdoch, or a Clinton, and may the gods
have mercy on your soul. On the flipside, your distinct
features might not be especially attractive (royal families are
notoriously inbred), and will mark you out for enemies of
the clan in question.
In social situations, this Merit might be worth a -2 reduction for the difficulty of social rolls that involve people who
care about things like aristocracy, but would also increase your
difficulty by +2 if you’re dealing with folks who hate that noble
family’s guts! In all cases, this Merit reflects an actual genetic
connection, not simply a cosmetic resemblance… which could
provide all kinds of complications when magick and its secret
histories are involved.
While it might be worth some social currency, this Merit
does not in any way provide material wealth or other perks.
For such goodies, see Backgrounds like Influence, Rank, Resources, and so forth in the Mage 20 rulebook, Chapter Six.
For the social benefits of regal presence, see the Social Merit
Regal Bearing, elsewhere in this chapter.
Sterile (1 pt. Merit or Flaw)
For some physical reason, you’re unable to sire or conceive children. Whether this is a Merit or a Flaw depends
upon whether or not you want to sire or conceive children.
Generally, this sort of condition can be easily cured with a
little Life-Sphere magick; in your case, though, it can’t be
rectified until and unless you, the player, discard the Merit
or pay off this Flaw.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 37
Enchanting Feature (2 pt. Merit)
Blessed with magnificent eyes, sleek hair, mighty biceps,
preternatural grace, ripped abs, a dazzling smile, or some other
standout physical feature, you can enchant people with the raw
perfection of that feature. The feature in question doesn’t need
to be visually obvious, either; maybe you smell good, possess
a seductive voice, move with animalistic allure, or enjoy some
likewise wondrous physical asset. (Please be tasteful here, folks.)
This Merit takes the place of related Physical Merits such
as Enchanting Gaze, Soothing Voice, Graceful, and other
potentially similar attributes. Story-wise, this Enchanting Feature becomes a standout part of your character’s description.
System-wise, you reduce the difficulty by -2 when your character
deploys the feature in question as part of some social feat.
If your mage employs his Enchanting Feature Merit as part
of his magickal focus (see the Instruments entries for Eye Contact, Dance and Movement, Ordeals and Exertions, Sex and
Sensuality, Social Domination, and Voice and Vocalizations
in Mage 20, Chapter Ten), then you could count this Merit as
a personalized unique /specialized instrument (as detailed in
Mage 20, pp. 503 and 588). On the plus side, this allows you
to reduce certain casting difficulties by -2 when the feature in
question is specifically employed in the casting of an Effect. On
the not-so-good side, this might get your mage’s eyes gouged
out, his face marred, his vocal cords cut, or… well, you get the
picture… if a particularly ruthless enemy considers that feature
to be “the focus of his power.”
Physically Impressive (2 pt. Merit)
You are one imposing sumbitch, not so much large as
apparently dangerous no matter what mood you might be in
at the time. This could be as obvious as scarring or an intimidating build, or as intangible as the proverbial “air of menace.”
System-wise, the Merit adds two dice to all Social-Trait rolls
that involve intimidating someone; story-wise, people find
you unnerving – and quite possibly attractive in a dangerous
way – even when you’re not trying to be impressive.
Poison Resistance (2 pt. Merit)
Toxins may sicken you, but probably won’t kill you. Although
magickal poisons may be the exception to this rule, your body
shakes off the worst effects of natural and synthesized poisons.
When attacked by such substances, add two dice to your
character’s Stamina roll when resisting their effects; a successful
roll reduces the intensity of powerful toxins, and eliminates
the deadlier effects of lesser ones altogether. Sure, she might
feel a little woozy and could get seriously ill, but even if you
fail that roll your character probably won’t die.38 The Book of Secrets
Although it works against toxic bacteria, this Merit does not
protect against diseases spread from viruses, genetic conditions,
and so forth. For details, see Drugs, Poisons, and Disease in
Mage 20, pp. 441-444 and 456. And because intoxicants are
toxins too, this Merit helps you survive overdoses of booze or
drugs – see Alcohol /Drug Tolerance, above.
Poker Face (2 pt. Merit)
Nothing rattles you. Nothing. The emergence of a
titanic elder thing from the depths of space might warrant
a concerned twitch of your mouth, but that’s really about
it. Oh, this doesn’t mean you don’t feel anything – that’s
the Mental Flaw: Icy, below. Your deadpan expression,
blank eyes, and flat tone of voice, however, reveal nothing
about your thoughts or intentions… which, for folks on the
receiving end of you, can be quite disconcerting; reduce the
difficulty of intimidation, subterfuge, and resistance-to-intimidation rolls by -2, while adding +2 to the difficulties of
anyone who tries to rattle your cage or get under your skin,
including attempts to read, seduce, torture, or otherwise
get past that poker face.
Daredevil (3 pt. Merit)
You laugh at danger. Even when daring the Fates with
near-suicidal impulsiveness, you possess an innate knack for
not getting yourself perished. Add three dice to non-combat
and non-magickal rolls that involve some physical act of incomprehensible stupidity (leaping from roof to roof, diving into
a waterfall, jumping a motorcycle onto the back of a moving
train, etc.) that would turn the average mortal into hash.
Hypersensitivity (3 pt. Merit)
Extraordinarily open to physical sensations, you possess
a depth of sensitivity most folks cannot conceive of having.
A mere sip of wine can reveal its vintage to you; a whiff of
smoke betrays the quality (or lack thereof) and origins of its
burnt tobacco; a faint touch can conjure up orgasmic ecstasies.
Story-wise, you can easily “fall into” an enjoyable sensation, relishing it to a degree far beyond typical human
sensitivity. System-wise, you reduce the difficulty by -2 if you’re
trying to use a Perception + Alertness roll to identify details
about a sensation. Assuming that you employ instruments like
Bodywork, Drugs, Energy, Eye Contact, Food and Drink,
or Sex and Sensuality (and you probably use most or all of
them), you can get more “bang for your buck” from such sensations, which allows you to employ those instruments faster,
and perhaps (Storyteller’s option) gives you a -2 reduction to
the difficulty of associated Ability rolls. The normal modifier
limits still apply.
On the flipside, however, painful sensations and overstimulation can trigger paralyzing agonies and intense panic.
Whenever you experience a painful sensation without your
consent (that is, being flogged against your will, subjected
to loud music that you didn’t wish to hear, or injured by
something you didn’t want to be hurt by), you must make a
Willpower roll to avoid being “dragged under” and stunned
by the pain for a turn or two. (See Stunning in Mage 20, p.
417.) That roll’s difficulty depends upon the intensity of the
pain – from difficulty 4 for a minor annoyance, to difficulty
10 for screaming agony. As any Cultist can tell you, ecstasy is
indeed a two-way street!
Although this Merit goes well with Acute Senses, it cannot
be taken by a character who’s also Insensate to Pain (detailed
below).
Nightsight (3 pt. Merit)
Unlike most people, you can see in near-total darkness.
Only the complete absence of visible light will negate this
ability. In even the dimmest light, your visual abilities remain
essentially unimpaired.
This Merit does not increase your character’s visual capacity – for that gift, see Acute Senses, above; it does, however,
mean that low light does not impose any sort of penalty on
her visual perception rolls. Other visual impediments, like
smoke or fog, block her sight as usual, and magickally-imposed
darkness (for instance, the sort caused by deflecting light with
the Forces Sphere) negates this Merit if and when it involves
the dispersal of light itself.
Huge Size (4 pt. Merit)
You’re far bigger than usual – possibly over seven feet
tall and /or over 400 pounds in weight. Such large people
stand out in a crowd, and have a hard time literally “fitting
in” to a world built for smaller human beings. Still, your
character’s large build gives him one additional health level,
which counts as an extra level of Bruised when it comes to
wound-based penalties. If he shapeshifts into a smaller form
through Life-based magick, that extra health level goes away.
In his normal form, however, this large character can be quite
imposing and hard to beat.
Insensate to Pain (5 pt. Merit)
Nothing hurts until it kills you. Okay, it probably does hurt,
but not enough to slow you down. Wound penalties do not
affect your character at all; until she dies, she usually functions
with her full dice pools intact. This Merit does not in any way
change the way in which she takes damage – for that Merit, see
below – but it radically changes the way said damage affects
her ability to get things done.
There is, of course, a downside to all this: Pain tells us
that we’re not functioning properly and should probably
stop while we’re ahead. And so, you’ll also do stuff like
burn yourself by accident, try to walk on broken legs, and
notice cuts only when the blood is seeping through your
shirt. Although pain won’t slow you down, shattered bones
and organs will. Injuries that inflict significant physical impairment (crushed legs, broken skull, gouged-out eyes, etc.)
supersede your usual immunity to dice-pool penalties dueChapter One: Heroic Traits 39
to wounds, and you might inflict further lethal injury upon
yourself (Storyteller’s option) if you keep going after your
body tries to tell you to stop.
Too Tough to Die (5 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 644.
Physical Flaws
As any Life-skilled mage understands, “average” is a meaningless concept with regards to biological organisms. Even so,
certain features of a physical body make it harder for a person
to function in a world that’s often built for “average” people.
Physical Flaws reflect limitations of a character’s body that are
not – without magick, technology or both – things she can repair.
That said, a person with such “flaws” is often more resourceful
than someone who hasn’t had to work around those obstacles.
Physical Flaws also make excellent Genetic Flaws for
Enhanced and genegineered characters, as described in Mage
20, p. 650. Taken that way, however, each Flaw is worth only
one point, and so you’d be better off taking most such Flaws
in addition to the Genetic ones unless the Flaw in question is
worth only one or two points to begin with.
Addiction (1 or 3 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, p. 646.
Child (1 to 3 pt. Flaw)
Awakening often hits before legal maturity. This wasn’t a
problem in the old days, but within modern society a young mage
has certain built-in limitations: physical size, life experience,
legal status (or lack thereof), and the challenges of being taken
seriously in a grown-up world. Perhaps you’re a child prodigy…
or an adolescent whose reality truly is beyond understanding.
In any case, this Flaw represents the social, legal, and physical
obstacles of being a kid.
Depending on the value of this Flaw, your character might
be a young child (3 points), a pre-adolescent young person (2
points), or someone near the verge of adulthood but not quite
there (1 point). In the first two cases, you should also take Short
to reflect a growing body… and in all cases, your ability to run
with the mages is going to be limited by your age and the ways
in which people react to it. For more details, see Child-Mages
in Chapter Two, pp. 115-116.
Impediment (1 to 6 pt. Flaw)
Due to some physical condition, you’re less able to deal
with certain situations than most other people seem to be
able to do. And if all of that sounds very conditional, that’s
because the specifics of this Flaw depend a lot on the following
circumstances:
• What sort of condition you have.
• How much it gets in your way.
• Whether or not other people can tell that it gets in
your way.
Literally speaking, an impediment interferes with your path
by “blocking your feet.” System-wise, this Flaw reflects any sort
of impairment that’s based in your character’s physical situation.
That includes neurological and internal chemical conditions
like autism, dyslexia, chronic fatigue, significant allergies, and
other maladies that may be “invisible” to others but which are
rooted in the physical body, as opposed to in the psyche or the
spirit. Such conditions might be linked to psychological and
/or spiritual health too; those elements are interrelated, of
course. For the purposes of this Flaw, however, an Impediment
is something that hampers the character’s ability to function
in the physical realm.
Story-wise, an Impediment can be any body-based condition – obvious or not – that interferes with your character’s
ability to do stuff. Examples of obvious Impediments include a
missing limb, a limp, a bent spine, missing teeth, heavy scarring,
deformed features, and the like, while “invisible” Impediments
would include chronic pain and /or fatigue, poor eyesight,
asthma, internal tumors, sensory processing disorders, and so
forth. The more that condition impedes your character, the
more this Flaw is worth:
• (1point) Like chronic headaches, impaired vision, minor
arthritis or a few missing teeth, the Impediment presents
occasional inconveniences but is not a major hassle in
your life unless something worsens the condition or
removes the things (glasses, dentures, pain reliever) that
you use to compensate for it.
• (2 points) As with dyslexia, high-functioning Asperger’s
syndrome, chronic fatigue or pain, poor or deteriorating
eyesight, or other internal obstacles, your Impediment
presents constant but not insurmountable problems.
In certain situations, you may suffer a +1 to difficulties
that deal with that element of your life.
• (3 points) Your Impediment – severe migraines, significant autism, allergies or asthma, missing fingers or an
eye, near-deafness, palsy, Tourette’s syndrome, deteriorating limb(s), and so forth – significantly impairs several
elements of your everyday life. System-wise, you add +1
to difficulties related to your Impediment.
• (4 points) An inescapable Impediment – missing limb,
profound deafness or autism, near-blindness, malformed
bones or connective tissues (as with EDS, mentioned
above), severe arthritis, gnarled hands or feet, and similar obstacles – forces you to try working around that
condition on a daily basis. Under most circumstances,
you add +2 to difficulties related to that Impediment,
and certain situations (like a nasty allergic reaction)
might damage your health and endanger your life.40 The Book of Secrets
• (5 points) Thanks to a profound physical condition –
partial paralysis, constant and severe pain, advanced
cancer, the inability to hear or speak, muscular-skeletal
deterioration, major sight-loss, and other maladies –
you’re unable to function in most ways that people take
for granted. Add +2 to physical difficulties unless you’ve
got a reliable way to compensate for that handicap, and
assume that you simply cannot do certain things at all.
• (6 points) For whatever reasons, your condition is so advanced and severe that you need major work-arounds in
order to function in the everyday world. Many physical feats
are beyond you, and you add +2 or even +3 to difficulties
of things you can do but only with a major effort.
The Flaw reflects practical impairment in the character’s life;
if your mage has a cybernetic arm that acts like his original arm
only better, then that character is not impaired until or unless that
arm breaks down. If someone cures this condition with magick
or some other treatment, then the character loses this Flaw.
All forms of Impediment are not created equal, and so one
“blind” person can function in the seeing world better (that is, with
fewer points in the Flaw) than another visually-impaired person
(with more points in the Flaw) can do. The Impediment’s value
may also reflect several different conditions that, taken together,
impede that character’s ability to function “normally” more than
any single condition does. As an example, this author has dyslexia,
dyscalculia, poor vision, and two chronically injured knees; does
this stop him? No. Does it slow him down in certain respects? It
sure does, and so the total of his “Flaw” would reflect the amount
of difficulty that these conditions, all told, present in daily life.
This Flaw serves as a catch-all for previously published
Physical Flaws like Blind, Deaf, and especially the pejorative
Lame. Unlike many of the labels applied to such “handicaps,”
the Impediment Flaw does not carry any form of judgment on the
part of the game itself; although characters (and players) might
think less of a “lazy” person with five points in Impediment due
to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, the Flaw itself is not intended
in any way to be an insult against people with such conditions.
On that note, an unobvious Impediment may present
significant social challenges; a person with Tourette’s Syndrome
may seem perfectly healthy even as her brain misfires, with the
only visible symptoms being “inappropriate” sounds or actions.
(See the Mental Flaw:Inappropriate,p. 46) That mage with CFS
could be considered “too lazy to get out of bed” by people who
don’t see her body sabotaging her from the inside out. And so,
the value of the Flaw – with the Storyteller’s approval – might
reflect a penalty to social-based rolls instead of physical ones in
certain situations. (“Why weren’t you at work again?” “I couldn’t
take ten steps without falling over.” “Yeah, right…”)
Aging (2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 pt. Flaw)
You ain’t as young as you used to be… or perhaps you’re a little
tooyoung. The years have taken their toll on your physical capacities,
and while the spirit may be willing, the body most certainly is not.
System-wise, this Flaw reflects the diminished capabilities
of a body that is either too old or too young to employ its full
adult potential. For every two points in this Flaw, the character
loses one dot from a Physical Attribute (Strength, Dexterity or
Stamina), either because his body is aging past its prime, or
because it has not yet developed to mature capacity.
In the latter case, a young child (see the Flaw: Child,
above) should also take 4 points in this Flaw, with an older
child taking 2 points. Adolescent characters, obviously, have
no such physical limitations due to age, although they could
have other sorts of health issues, as described above under the
Flaw: Impediment.
Previous editions of this Flaw – that is, ones that were
written by authors in their 20s or early 30s – maintained that
a character must lose one dot of Physical Attributes for each
decade over 40. As this author (currently in his 50s, and in
better shape than he was at half this age) can attest, that’s
nonsense. A person can maintain, or even exceed, a young
adult’s physical capabilities well into middle age, and mages
– who employ Life magicks, yoga, and other forms of physical
conditioning – often age even better than most people do.
Considering that a skilled mage can live for centuries with little
(or no) loss of her physical abilities, this Flaw is not bound to
a character’s chronological age, only to her physical health in
relation to that age. Even so, ancient mages can get pretty frail.
For health problems related to greater stages of decrepitude,
see Impediment, above.
Easily Intoxicated (2 pt. Flaw)
Shit really fucks you up fast. The flipside of Alcohol /Drug
Tolerance, above, this Flaw renders you especially susceptible
to intoxication. Your Stamina rolls to resist the effects of drugs
or poisons (though not disease), as described in the Drugs,
Poisons, and Disease section of Mage 20, suffer a +3 modifier
to the usual difficulty involved. Contrary to popular conception,
this does not make you a good candidate for the Cult of Ecstasy
because you don’t control the drugs – the drugs control you.
Repulsive Feature (2 pt. Flaw)
Some physical feature of yours turns people away. Maybe
you smell bad regardless of your state of hygiene, possess the
proverbial “evil eye,” have an especially grating voice, suffer
from a pervasive skin condition, or have a similarly repugnant
physical characteristic. Perhaps the mere presence of you makes
people’s skins crawl even though there’s nothing discernibly
ugly about you. In any case, this feature discourages folks from
sticking around much.
Essentially the inverse of the Merit: Enchanting Feature,
this Flaw represents a concealable yet disconcerting element of
your physical presence. UnlikeImpediment, this Feature affects
the way people regard you, not the way your body functions. That
said, you could take both Flaws together, in order to reflect a
physically debilitating condition that has socially awkward effects
as well. The feature in question doesn’t represent overall ugliness,Chapter One: Heroic Traits 41
as per Monstrous and Horrific, below; instead, it manifests as
a single unpleasant physical distinction.
System-wise, this Flaw adds a +2 difficulty modifier to
Social-Trait rolls whenever this feature comes into play. Story-wise, this Flaw renders you physically distinctive unless you
make an effort to hide the Repulsive Feature. If you change
shape, that feature carries over into your other forms, which
interferes with disguise attempts. If the feature transcends visual
senses (like, for example, an unpleasant odor or grating voice),
it might betray your presence even if you can’t be seen. In both
cases, this Flaw penalizes your rolls for physical concealment
the same way it penalizes your social interactions.
As some consolation, the feature could be used to deliberately frighten or irritate people; in that case, the usual penalty
becomes a -2 to your difficulty instead. A Repulsive Feature that
has been integrated into your magickal focus (again, for instance,
the “evil eye”) offers the same instrumental benefits described
underEnchanting Feature, with the same potential for mutilation
and a greater incentive for someone to mess you up!
Profiled Appearance (2 pt. Flaw)
You look like one of those people… y’know, the people
that “respectable citizens” expect bad things from. Depending
on the setting of your chronicle, this could involve physical
mannerisms, body art, gender distinctions, individual features,
ethnic heritage, cybernetic modifications, or other elements
of your physical body that you cannot remove and probably
don’t want to “fix” anyhow. Problem is, the people around
you are constantly watching your every move, making trouble
for you when they can get away with it, and otherwise causing
you grief. The authorities shake you down on principle, and
most folks won’t object to whatever they choose to do to you.
Although it’s related to the Social Flaw: Cultural Other
(below), Profiled Appearance is based on your character’s
physical features, not on their social behavior. Although it can
be concealed to some degree, your Profiled Appearance is not
something that can be removed without magick, and it reflects
an essential part of your identity. Like Impediment, it does not
carry a value judgment in the game even though it represents the
way other characters will view you. If this feels unfair in the
game, imagine how it must feel in real life.
Degeneration (3, 6 or 9 pt. Flaw)
Your body is falling apart. A curse, disease, flawed biotech,
corrupting magicks, or some other affliction is rotting your
physical form, and although Life magick can repair the damage
to some degree, this degeneration remains permanent unless
the Flaw is somehow removed.
In its three-point variation, this Flaw reflects an inability to
heal injuries without the aid of magick or medical technology.
Until treated by Life Sphere Effects or medical intervention,
the character cannot recover heath levels lost to injury, disease
or other factors.
At the six-point level, the character suffers a constant
stream of injuries even without outside trauma. Whenever he’s
at full Health, that character loses one health level every two
weeks until he is either healed or he dies. As described above,
he cannot heal on his own.
At the nine-point level, that Health loss is essentially aggravated damage, and cannot be healed except through vulgar
Life-Sphere Effects.
Obviously, this Flaw is meaningless in one-shots or
short-duration games. It should be taken only by characters
(and players) involved in long-term chronicles.
Monstrous (3 pt. Flaw)
A frightening appearance marks you as an outsider. Regardless of your true personality and temperament, some profound
deformities, scars, body mods or other characteristics fill people
with terror and revulsion. System-wise, your character has an
Appearance of 0, and probably suffers penalties to social-based
rolls to win people over, while getting difficulty reductions
when trying to scare people, depending upon what he looks
like and who he’s dealing with.
Permanent Wound (3 pt. Flaw)
Due to lasting injury, Pattern leakage, a Paradox Flaw,
or some other physiological deficit, you suffer from a chronic
injury that never heals. This might be an incurable tumor,
endless bleeding, debilitating pain, brittle bones… the specifics are not important. Regardless of the cause, your character
is always at the Wounded health level; even with magickal
healing, the injury returns to its normal state at either sunrise
or sunset (your choice) every day. Although this wound does
not deteriorate further unless your character gets injured by
some other source – at which point, another four health levels
in damage can kill your character – this Permanent Wound
does not recover to a healthy state until and unless the Flaw is
bought off through a dramatic story-based cure.
Short (3 pt. Flaw)
Whether you’re the next Harry Potter or a budding Tyrion Lannister, you’re shorter than five feet tall… possibly a lot
shorter than that. In game terms, your character runs at half
the normal speed, has problems reaching certain things, lacks
the physical leverage for certain feats, and probably gets a lot
of shit from people who refuse to take him seriously.
Horrific (5 pt. Flaw)
Well pastMonstrous, you’re hideous to the point of inspiring
nightmares. Unless you mask your true form with serious magick,
people and animals run screaming from your presence. Physically,
you’re not merely misshapen but repulsive on a primal level – the
sort of terror that sent Lovecraft’s heroes over the edge. You might
not actually be a Nephandus or Marauder, but folks who know
what those words mean will assume that you are one. A normal
life is, for you, impossible. Whether due to Paradox disfigurement,42 The Book of Secrets
malignant disease, extreme body modifications (cybernetic, artistic,
or otherwise), severe scarring, or similar acts of malevolent fate,
you look like John Cobb threw up on you, then ran.
System-wise, this Flaw inflicts a +3 difficulty modifier to any
social roll that involvesnotscaring the shit out of people, and lowers
the difficulty by -3 if you are. Your Appearance Trait is stuck below
zero, and faint-hearted or weak-willed Storyteller characters may be
faced with Things Man Was Not Meant to Know (as per Mage
20, p. 407) if they wind up spending time with you.
Mayfly Curse (5 or 10 pt. Flaw)
Your lifespan burns bright and fast. Due, perhaps, to
biotech, cloning, or some other inhuman heritage or modification, you age far more quickly than normal human beings
do. While this means that you reach(ed) maturity in record
time, it ushers in premature decrepitude. When you live this
fast, kid, one way or another, you’re dying young!
At the five-point level of this Flaw, your character ages one
year for every two months of earthly time (six years of age for
each passing year). At the 10-point level, he ages one year per
week (or 52 years of age in a single 12-month period). Such a
character had best watch out for Time-savvy mages; the Accelerated Youth or Decay feat described in How Do You DO That?
( pp. 111-112) has horrific effects on a mayfly, who suffers six
to 52 years of aging for each year of time inflicted upon him.
As the years rush in, other Flaws like Aging, Impediment,
Absent-Minded, and so forth may pile up on this character as
well. Life-Sphere magick cannot negate this Flaw, which could be
interpreted as a manifestation of the Unbelief form of Paradox,
unless the player buys off the Flaw… and perhaps not even then.
Mental Merits
Mages depend upon their mental faculties. Although vampires, werefolk, and the like prize certain mental aptitudes, most
Neurodiversity and Mental Traits
Minds aren’t machines. For all the talk of “normal brains” and “average functionality,” medical research and social
activism have shown that such ideas are absurd. In older days, people slapped labels on folks whose mental capabilities
seemed to be “different”: slow, moron, diminished capacity, retarded. (Also, brilliant, genius, egghead, and savant.)
Some people cling to those definitions even now. In the twenty-first century, however, two terms have gained preference
over those old labels: neurodivergence and neurodiversity.
Essentially,neurodivergencemeans “someone whose brain-functions diverge from the human norm,” while neurodiversity
means “all of our brains work differently, so let’s respect our differences.” Some folks argue that the latter term is too
broad-ranging and “politically correct” to be useful, while others assert that neurodivergent is an insult which holds
human minds to an unrealistic standard. Both arguments have merit; severe mental conditions do interfere with a
person’s ability to function in the everyday world, and it is insulting to call folks “divergent” when their minds work
along different lines than other people’s minds do. (Maybe less insulting than moron, but you get the idea.) As of this
writing, neurodiversity is the preferred term among people who want to be inclusive, not divisive, with regards to the
vast range of human minds.
What does this have to do with Mage? For starters, both Merits and Flaws in the Mental category reflect “divergence”
from supposedly normal mental functions. If these traits didn’t diverge from the norm, they would not be “merits” or
“flaws.” Secondly, both the benefits and the drawbacks originate with the same source: mental capacity that ranges
beyond the apparent human norm. People whose minds work differently than other people’s minds work have pluses
in some regards and minuses in others. And so, a character who has, say, Lightning Calculator might also behave
in ways that are Inappropriate to many situations. This works the opposite way too – witness the ways in which
autistic people often Hyperfocus with uncanny acuity. Mental conditions, pro and con, tend to be intertwined. The
conditions that nurture the Merit often nurture the Flaw as well, and so characters with Mental Merits or Flaws really
ought to have both.
Because neurological conditions like dyslexia and the autistic spectrum have physical causes which affect mental
processing, such conditions are considered, in game terms, to be Impediments, as in the Physical Flaw of that name.
(See pp. 39-40.) The ways in which they manifest, though, can come through as Mental Merits and /or Flaws too.
Other, more nebulous conditions, like Chronic Depression, may have physical sources with predominantly mental
results for one character, and completely psychological sources for another. Such distinctions, of course, fall into the
rather Technocratic mind /body Cartesian duality thing, which doesn’t really suit the spirit of Mage. To be honest, all
these distinctions are arbitrary anyhow. Minds aren’t lists of game traits, either. It really doesn’t matter whether a given
Merit or Flaw is Physical, Mental, Social, or even Supernatural – only that it guides roleplaying and affects gameplay.
Technically, all mages are neurodivergent. Awakened consciousness is functionally different than a Sleeping mind,
and can perform tasks (like, say, magick) that a “normal” mind cannot manage. Even so, mental Merits and Flaws
represent significant departures from what the “average” mage can do, and so a character who has such Traits is
functioning on a different mental plane – for better and worse – than the characters who do not. When choosing such
Traits, and roleplaying them out, we recommend keeping that fact literally in mind.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 43
Awakened characters favor those abilities over all else. And so,
it’s likely that your mage will have at least one Mental Merit…
and, all things being related, may well suffer from Mental Flaws
as well, as described in the sidebar nearby.
Like Physical Flaws, Mental Flaws make excellent Genetic
Flaws for Enhanced and biomodded characters, especially for
ones whose “modifications” and /or origins remain essentially
invisible to the naked eye. Constructs (Technocratic and otherwise) are especially subject to such conditions. See the heading
Physical Flaws for details.
Artistically Gifted (1 pt. Merit)
The Muses work their will through you, or so it appears.
Whenever you employ your artistic talent (as in, the Talent: Art
in Mage 20, p. 275), reduce the difficulty of those rolls by -2. As
with other Merits of this kind,this Merit does not reduce the difficulty
of magick-casting rolls, but may reduce the difficulty of Attribute
+ Ability rolls that are involved with magickal acts. (For more
details, see Abilities Enhancing Magick, Mage 20, pp. 533.)
Common Sense (1 pt. Merit)
If such sense were truly common, there wouldn’t be a
Merit to represent it. Still, you have a gift for thinking one
step ahead and assessing the potential consequences of your
choices. Essentially, this Merit gives you a Get Out of Doing
Something Stupid Free card; whenever you announce an action that wouldn’t be especially bright (for example, throwing
a Time-Sphere spell at Old Man Wrinkle), the Storyteller may
ask, “Are you sure you wanna do that?” Thus warned, you’re free
to ignore the advice of your smarter angels. Still, you do get a
momentary insight into potential dumbassery, which is more
than most people get. Use it wisely.
Computer Aptitude (1 pt. Merit)
A true child of the twenty-first century, you’re especially
adept with computerized infotech. Reduce all difficulties
involving computer-based rolls by -2, up to the usual modifier
limit. This last caveat is especially important when dealing with
computer-based magickal Effects, whose difficulties cannot be
reduced by this Merit beyond the usual magick-roll modifier of -3,
or below the minimum difficulty for magick-casting rolls. Even
so, this Merit provides an edge for mages whose Arts include
the guiding technology of our age.
For detailed optional rules regarding computer usage, see
Computer Systems in Chapter Two, pp. 116-127.
Concentration (1 pt. Merit)
Even by mage standards, you’re especially good at tuning
out distractions. When you’re attempting some sort of feat that
demands focus (as most do), this Merit eliminates modifiers44 The Book of Secrets
that would be caused by distracting circumstances – gunfire,
thunderstorms, rampaging critters from beyond the stars, and
so forth. Truly distracting situations (trying to hack a computer
system during a tornado, for instance) might demand a successful Willpower roll in order to wipe out the potential penalty;
the difficulty would depend upon the circumstances. For the
most part, though, you get in and get stuff done, whatever else
might be going on around you.
Expert Driver (1 pt. Merit)
You were born to drive like a demon wherever the road
takes you. All of your driving-roll difficulties are reduced by -2.
Language (1 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 643.
Lightning Calculator (1 pt. Merit)
Your head is a calculator of impressive capability. With
a few moments of thought, you can perform intricate mathematical feats – a useful talent for Hermetic wizards, Syndicate
operatives, Enlightened engineers, and other mages who employ
math and geometry in their work.
System-wise, this Merit allows you to reduce the difficulties
of math- and calculation-based rolls by -2. Simple calculations
take no time at all, while sophisticated problems may demand
a turn or more. Obviously, your character needs access to the
proper data before she can work out calculations… and garbage
in, garbage out, so make sure your data is accurate!
For potential applications of math in magick, see the
instrument entries for Circles and Geometric Designs,
Formulae and Math, Money and Wealth, and Numbers
and Numerology in Mage 20, pp. 590-596, as well as the
practices of Hypereconomics (pg. 573), High Ritual Magick
and Hypertech (pp. 578-579), and Reality Hacking (pp. 581-
582). Remember that Merits cannot reduce the difficulty of
a magick-casting roll below the minimum difficulty, or by
more than -3. That said, fast and accurate calculations make
useful aids when you’re using Mundane Skills and Magickal
Effects, as described in the entry of that name (Mage 20, pp.
532-534). Depending upon the feat in question, this could
employ a roll of Intelligence + Academics to work out most
calculations, Perception + Academics to discern odds or
geometrical dimensions, and Wits + Academics to belt out
rapid guesstimates with only the roughest of data.
Mechanical Aptitude (1 pt. Merit)
Oh, you technophile, you! Blessed by the machine gods,
you’ve got a knack for mechanical gear. As with most Merits of
this type, such aptitude allows you to reduce difficulties by -2
when you’re making rolls based around working with mechanical technology. No, you don’t have to be a technomancer to
use such a gift, much less a member of the Technocracy; still,
this aptitude does suggest that mechanical technology means
a great deal to you, which – by extension – suggests that your
paradigm, practice, and instruments have something to do with
applications of mechanical principles and tech. For suggestions,
see the paradigms A Mechanistic Cosmos, Everything is Data,
and Tech Holds All the Answers in Mage 20, pp. 568-571, as
well as the related practices and instruments and the related
material in this book’s Chapter Three. For more practical
applications of this Merit, meanwhile, see Mage 20’s section
regarding The Technological World, pp. 458-464.
Time Sense (1 pt. Merit)
You’ve got an intuitive sense of what time it is in your
vicinity. Much like the Rank 1 Time Effect, but without the
ability to spot ripples in the time stream, this Merit provides
a sort of internal clock that helps you gauge the time of day
and the passing of time even when you don’t have access to
windows, clocks, or other information about time.
This Merit does not grant bonuses or decrease difficulties
for Time Sphere-based magick-casting rolls. It does, however,
give one of the benefits of basic Time Sphere perceptions to
characters who do not employ the Time Sphere.
Code of Honor (2 pt. Merit)
Guided by a strong sense of ethics, you follow a particular
standard of conduct. This might be a military honor-code,
a religious creed, the law of a given fellowship to which you
belong, or possibly your personal moral center. Regardless
of its origins, this code guides your decisions, informs your
activities, and sometimes forces you to make hard choices that
less-ethical people never face.
Thanks to that code, your character gains two additional
dice to all Willpower rolls when he acts in accordance with his
code of honor, or when he resists some temptation or compulsion that might get him to betray that code. Obviously, you and
your Storyteller should work out the specific tenets of this code
during the character-creation process. If you do not honor that
code, then you’ll probably lose the Merit… and suffer disgrace,
as well, among other parties who know and respect your vows.
Eidetic Memory (2 pt. Merit)
Gifted with the proverbial photographic memory, you
clearly recall details about something you read, view, or otherwise experience. A serious boon for ritual magicians, field ops,
and tech-minded magi, this Merit lets your character remember
stuff even if you, the player, do not.
Under most circumstances, your character easily recalls
the memories in question. Really detailed memories, or ones
gathered under stressful conditions, might require a Perception
+ Alertness roll before the character can remember essential
elements of the moment she’s trying to recall.
Memory, of course, is subjective, and so while this Merit
allows you remember things as you perceive them, those memories
will still be based upon your perspective – internal as well as
external – which is not the same as having access to some objective god-view of that experience! Especially in a game aboutChapter One: Heroic Traits 45
subjective reality, that’s an important distinction – one that
also keeps this Merit from becoming a potential game-breaker.
Folks with such memories are often subject to PTSD, as in
the Flaw of that name. That’s especially true when people face
Things Man Was Not Meant to Know, as described in Mage
20, p. 407. Vivid recall has its drawbacks, and in the traumatic
world of a mage, some things really are best forgotten!
Inner Strength (2 pt. Merit)
Faced with adversity, you prevail. System-wise, this Merit
reduces the difficulty of Willpower rolls by -2 when you struggle
against apparently overwhelming odds.
Natural Linguist (2 pt. Merit)
You’re especially good at understanding how people communicate. Every purchase of the Language Merit (see above,
and Mage 20, Appendix II) secures two languages for you,
not just one. You also get three bonus dice when making rolls
based upon clear communications, typically ones employing
Art, Expression, Etiquette, Leadership, and other Traits that
involve “speaking their language” to impress someone else.
This Merit does not add three dice to magickal casting rolls
when using language as an instrument. It may, however, apply the
bonus to a mundane roll that could enhance a magick- casting
attempt – see Abilities Enhancing Magick, Mage 20, p. 533.
Hyperfocus (3 pt. Merit)
Given time and a lack of distractions, you can focus your
mind to an uncanny extent. For every hour spent focusing
without distractions on a mundane task (not on a magick-casting
roll), you may add one die to your dice pool for each roll made
during an extended action (as described in Mage 20, p. 389).
This bonus has a limit of three dice, total. So if, for example,
Nix has Hyperfocus and spends two hours on a task, zir player
adds two extra dice to Nix’s dice pool; three hours’ focus provide
three dice, but four hours of focus keeps those three dice. All
two or three dice, however, get used every time Nix’s player
makes a roll to complete that extended action.
As noted above, this Merit does not assist magickal casting rolls. Due to the time required to focus – and the lack of
distractions involved – Hyperfocus doesn’t help in combat
situations either, although a strategy-minded character could
hyperfocus on planning for a battle, but not on fighting it
once the combat began. On a similar note, a mage could use
Hyperfocus to aid in the mundane elements of a ritual – see
Rituals and Mundane Abilities, Mage 20, p. 541.
Extreme hyperfocus is often (though not exclusively) associated with people on the autistic spectrum, although some
authorities claim that perseveration (see the Flaw: Mental Lock)
is more a more accurate way of looking at that intense form of
focus. With or without autism, this Merit comes in handy for
Hermetics, technomancers, shamans, and other mages whose
practices depend upon extreme dedication to certain tasks.
Iron Will (3 pt. Merit)
Even by Awakened standards, you possess a formidable
will. When you make up your mind or dig in your heels
against mental influence, your determination’s hard to break.
System-wise, your character receives three extra dice for his
Willpower rolls whenever he faces a challenge to his convictions,
or resists attempts at Mind magick, torture, exhaustion, and
other debilitating attacks. If the character ever crosses paths
with a vampire or other mind-controlling entity, he can shake
off the effects of such assaults by spending a single Willpower
point. See also the Resisting feat on the Dramatic Feats chart,
Mage 20, p. 403.
Jack-of-All-Trades (3 pt. Merit)
You know a little about a lot. When attempting to make
a roll using a Skill (not a Talent) that your character does not
possess, you don’t suffer the usual penalty. (See Skills, Mage 20,
p. 279.) If you’re trying to use a Knowledge your character does
not possess, you can still make the roll but with an addition of
+2 to the normal difficulty. (See Knowledges, Mage 20, p. 283.)
Because Talent Traits represent innate gifts honed by
practice, this Merit does not grant access to Talents that your
character does not possess.
Scientific Mystic /Techgnosi (3 pt. Merit)
Certain unorthodox technomancers understand that
“mysticism” is just another form of science whose principles
may be understood by a properly Enlightened mind. Although
you pursue a technological practice and employ tech-based
instruments, you can employ instruments that are traditionally
considered to be “magic” once you’ve had an opportunity to
study them and fit those tools into your scientific paradigm.
TheScientific MysticMerit lets a dedicated technomancer
– that is, a member of the Society of Ether, the Virtual Adepts,
a tech-based “orphan,” or perhaps even a rogue Technocrat
like the Disparates of Navalon – study metaphysical principles from mystic-paradigm mages for no extra point-cost if
that technomancer has the focus practice Weird Science.
(For details, see Can a Mage Who Uses One Type of Focus
Learn Magick from a Mage Who Uses a Different Kind of
Focus?, Chapter Three, p. 174, and the Weird Science entry in
Mage 20, p. 584.) That technomancer can also choose traditionally “mystic” tools as up to half of her required instruments
(as detailed under Arete, Focus, and Instruments in Mage 20,
p. 329), and can discard those instruments as a mystic instead
of as a technomancer (again, see Mage 20, p. 329). Essentially,
this means that your approach to Enlightened science is flexible
enough to embrace bizarre approaches to your metaphysical
pursuits. Other scientists might consider such things impossible, but you realize that “possibility” is what you make of it.
On the other side of that metaphysical coin, the Techgnosi
Merit allows a dedicated mystic to do the exact same things,
but with technological instruments and no extra cost involved46 The Book of Secrets
in studying magick from technomancer peers, regardless of
your practices. (See the Chapter Three entry cited above.) Yes,
your soul belongs to the Mysteries, but you’ve recognized that
technology has a place in those Mysteries as well.
Berserker (4 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 644, and the Flaw: Stress Atavism.
Judge’s Wisdom (4 pt. Merit)
Through firm self-discipline, you have mastered your emotions
to Vulcan perfection. No passion-based assault can rattle your
judgment, and the base attacks of heart-twisting fiends have little
hold on you. Rules-wise, you remain immune to Mind- or Lifebased Effects that influence emotions (as detailed in How Do You
DO That?, pp. 60 and 120-122), and can shrug off the vampiric
Discipline of Presence unless that bloodsucker has at least six dots
in that Discipline. Emotion-based powers from werecreatures,
faeries, and other such creatures cannot affect you, although you
can still be possessed, mind-controlled, enchanted, and otherwise
bent or broken so long as the assault is not based on wrangling an
emotional response from your perfect serene command.
Self-Confident (5 pt. Merit)
Mages are confident; you’re even more so. When spending
Willpower to gain an automatic success, you don’t even need
to lose that point of Willpower unless:
1) The Willpower-gained success is the only success you
get for that action; or…
2) the difficulty for that action is 5 or less. This Merit
kicks in only in challenging circumstances, and tasks with a
difficulty of 5 or lower are just too easy to demand help from
your character’s self-confidence.
Mental Flaws
Mages tend – with good reason! – to be seen as crazy,
obsessive, or otherwise touched in the head. And so, mental
Flaws are common among those nutty Awakened types, most
especially the ones who, for reasons mentioned earlier in
the Neurodiversity and Mental Traits sidebar, have mental
Merits as well.
Compulsion (1 pt. Flaw)
An almost reflexive mental tic drives you toward compulsive, often subconscious, behaviors. In some cases, especially
among mages, these behaviors manifest as ritualized activities:
hand-washing, obsessive grooming, doing a task exactly the
same way every time, and so forth. Other compulsions inspire
annoying habits (humming, making farty noises with your
mouth, speaking out loud even when you don’t mean to, etc.),
or potentially harmful activities like shoplifting, gambling,
or hitting on everything that moves, which manifest when
you’re under stress. (A seriously harmful compulsion could be
considered a Derangement Flaw instead, as referenced below.)
Minor compulsions tend to get chalked up to the rationalization, “That’s just what she’s like.” If you want your
character to avoid a serious compulsion, however, you must
spend a Willpower point in order to put off that behavior for
a little while. However, once that little while is up (Storyteller’s
discretion), your character is again compelled to perform that
activity… unless you spend another Willpower point… to put
it off again for a little while longer…
Hero Worship (1 pt. Flaw)
You adore another character, to the point where that person
can do no wrong as far as you’re concerned. Attempts to sway
your opinion will just piss you off, shut you down, or drive
you to heights (or depths) of absurd justification for whatever
someone says about him. A common trait among folks in an
Echo Chamber (see the Social Flaw of that name, pp. 66-67),
this psychological blind spot can become annoying, even hazardous, if centered on the wrong person… like, say, a Syndicate
Manager, a Nephandus, or certain presidential candidates!
If your hero tells you to do something, you’re inclined to
obey, and must make a Willpower roll in order to refuse their
desires. The difficulty for this roll depends upon the extremity
of those desires; “Gimme a kiss,” would probably be difficulty 5,
while “Go stab your best friend in the back for me” would be 9 or 10.
If and when you’re confronted with proof of your hero’s weaknesses, you are capable of seeing reason eventually – it’s just not
easy to get you to think so clearly. Any social roll that’s aimed at
getting you to discard your hero worship adds +2 to its difficulty
unless the hero has recently done something very wrong… like,
say, telling you to stab your best friend in the back for him!
Impatient (1 pt. Flaw)
You’re driven to act now, not wait till later. In situations
where other folks seem to just take for-freakin’-ever to get something done, make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) to restrain
yourself from just running off to do it your own damn self! Yes,
that difficulty may go up if… maybe when… you have to wait
even longer than before. God, would the rest of the world would
just get moving already?
Inappropriate (1 to 4 pt. Flaw)
Wow – did you just go there? Yep, you did… and will go
there again soon enough. Thanks to some quirk of personality,
you tend to say and do things that other folks frown upon,
typically at the least appropriate times. You make cooked-cat
jokes in Asian restaurants, say what’s on your mind when it’s
best to keep your mouth shut, and stumble over courtesy like it
was a kiddie-gate you weren’t tall enough to avoid. This could
involve activities too, like picking your nose in front of an elder
or showing Martyrs to your 8-year-old niece. God damn it all,
what were you thinking?
Minds do weird shit, and so this Flaw reflects a mental
condition or psychological kink that drives the character toward
embarrassing behaviors. Contrary to popular belief, this does notChapter One: Heroic Traits 47
necessarily mean the character is Asperger’s /autistic, although
it could compliment the physical Flaw: Impediment if that
Flaw represents an autistic spectrum condition that manifests
in especially inappropriate behavior. (An autistic character does
not have to take this Flaw, as many folks on the spectrum do
not behave this way.) The quirk in question might come from
a strange upbringing, psychic trauma, past lives acting out
(“What? In MY day, this sort of thing was perfectly acceptable!”),
alien cultural mores, social isolation, Avatar dickery, or any
other mental stutter that screws with social-pattern recognition.
A physical condition, like autism or Tourette’s syndrome, is
more suited to the Impediment Flaw.
As with Impediment, the value of this Flaw depends upon
the degree to which it causes problems for your character:
• (1 point) You occasionally say and do silly shit that causes
small degrees of embarrassment to you and your friends.
+1 difficulty to social rolls if and when you act out.
• (2 points) Your quirk inspires some pretty mortifying
behavior on a fairly regular basis. +1 difficulty to many
social rolls, even when you’re not acting out at the
moment.
• (3 points) Dude, you need to STFD and STFU or
you’re going to be in big trouble… again. +2 difficulty
to all social rolls that aren’t related to making an ass of
yourself.
• (4 points) You are a source of constant headaches to
anyone who dares to identify as your friend. +2 difficulty
to social rolls, plus a bad reputation among folks who’ve
met or heard of you.
For obvious reasons, this Flaw could be a major-league
trigger for certain players, especially if the inappropriate behavior includes bigotry and /or sexual misbehavior. A player who
decides to take this Flaw should discuss it with her Storyteller
and fellow players… and if it becomes a source of real-life friction
around the table, the Flaw should be discarded, or else played
“offstage” rather than acted out in real time. (See Triggers,
Limits, and Boundaries in Mage 20, p. 345.) IT SHOULD
NEVER BE USED AS AN EXCUSE FOR REAL-LIFE DICKERY, EVER. (Was that clear enough?) This Flaw is intended
as a “mature audiences” option that reflects the unfortunate
effects of mental malfunctions and social maladjustments. If
a player cannot employ this Flaw in a mature manner, then it
should not be employed at all.
Mental Lock (1 pt. Flaw)
Somewhere in between impulse and action, things get stuck
inside your head. Thoughts or images wind up caught in mental
loops, and you occasionally find yourself tripping over words, getting
stuck in patterns of speech, or repeating apparently uncontrollable
activities (flapping your hands, shaking your head, rubbing your
wrists, and so forth) which, under most circumstances, would be
easy to stop or manage. Sometimes known asperseverationorstimming
(see the Merit:Hyperfocus), these mental tics often manifest from
brain damage, emotional trauma, intense stress, and /or autism
and other sensory-processing conditions. Conventionally and
incorrectly called “nervous habits,” these mental quirks may be
attempts to control your apparently chaotic surroundings by giving
your brain something that feels like you can control it. Problem is,
you essentially have to shake yourself out of the locked pattern,
concentrate on a new sensation in order to break the loop, invoke
a sort of “ritualized” word or action that triggers a break in that
loop, or employ some other method to break free of the mental
lock. Until that point, you could find yourself stuttering even
though you don’t have a speech impediment, feel “frozen” on
words or thoughts you can’t easily articulate, lock into near-obsessive
ruminations on nonsense phrases or perilous thoughts, get stuck
doing the same thing over and over again, or otherwise wind up
focused on an internal feedback cycle.
System-wise, the Storyteller will occasionally drop small but
annoying quirks into your character’s ability to speak, suggest
small, repetitious actions for your character to perform, and
otherwise screw with your character’s capacity to move beyond
a single nagging thought. To break those mental locks, you’ll
need to roll your character’s Willpower against difficulty 7,
spend a temporary point of Willpower, or else stand around
“locked up” in mid-thought or action until you can break that
irritating mental block through force of will or (after five turns)
the simple passage of time.
Nightmares (1 or 3 pt. Flaw)
Night, for you, is a long parade of imagined horrors. Almost every time you reach Dreamland, the inhabitants drag
you through hell until you finally manage to escape back to
the waking world. Your nightmares could come from psychic
trauma, abuse, brain damage, Quiet, Paradox, Social Processing,
encounters with Things Man Was Not Meant to Know, or
other things that mess with your head. Whatever their source,
these nocturnal hellrides affect your waking life as well.
Story-wise, these constant nightmares play havoc with your
character’s mood, sleep, and long-term sanity. (For examples,
see the Prelude for Mage 20.) At the three-point level, these
nightmares force the player to make a Willpower roll, difficulty
7, each time her character wakes up from sleep; a failed roll
subtracts one die from all of her dice pools that day. (Yes,
previously published versions of this Flaw inflict that penalty
on any character with the 1 pt. Nightmares Flaw. A full-die
penalty on all rolls for a day, however, seems out of proportion
with a one-point Flaw, and so this book introduces a three-point
variation on the Trait. Storytellers may decide to use the older
version of this Flaw for consistency’s sake.)
This Flaw makes an especially ugly companion to the
Background: Demesne (Mage 20, pp. 310-311). In this case,
the nightmares twist the Dream Realm into a perpetual horrorshow. Attempts to alter the dreamscape are at difficulty 7
(for the one-point Flaw) or 9 (for the three-point Flaw), and the48 The Book of Secrets
dreamscape will remain unpleasant, if bearably so, no matter
what the dreamer does to affect it. Those same difficulties apply
to a character who wants to change the dreams by using the
Talent: Lucid Dreaming (Mage 20, p. 294); change is possible,
then, but far from easy.
Overconfident (1 pt. Flaw)
You’re the best there is at what you do. If other folks disagree,
then that’s their problem, not yours! Nothing is beyond your
reach, and so you almost never back down from a challenge, no
matter how absurdly outmatched you appear to be at the time.
If things go poorly, of course, you can always blame someone
else. After all, it’s clearly not your fault!
Shy (1 pt. Flaw)
Interpersonal relations are not your forte. Commonly
known these days as social anxiety, this Flaw adds +2 to the
difficulty of your social rolls, thanks to your discomfort when
dealing with other folks. If, all the gods forbid, you wind up
as the center of attention (a situation you avoid whenever
possible), your social rolls gain a +3 addition to their difficulty.
Story-wise, this shyness comes across as avoidance, introversion,
and awkwardness in many social situations even when you
actually want to hang out and make a good impression.
Soft-Hearted (1 pt. Flaw)
You hate to witness suffering. Sadly, the World of Darkness
is filled with pain, and so you often find yourself either avoiding
potentially traumatic situations or trying to ease suffering even
when that puts you in the line of fire too.
When confronted with someone else’s physical or emotional pain, make a Willpower roll (difficulty 8). If you fail,
your character either withdraws from the situation or possibly
(if his beliefs /faith /paradigm /Nature demands action) does
something reckless in order to prevent further suffering. A
successful roll means that you can act normally… which could
still involve withdrawal or recklessness, but displaying a bit
more self-control.
Speech Impediment (1 pt. Flaw)
For psychological reasons (as opposed to a physical reason,
as per the Flaw: Impediment), you speak with some sort of
frustrating imperfection: a lisp, a stutter, a too-broad accent, a
whisper, and so forth. Clearly, this interferes with your attempts
to wax eloquent; System-wise, add +2 to the difficulty of rolls
that involve speaking clearly. This Flaw should be roleplayed
out whenever possible, and it carries over if your character
changes into some other form… after all, it’s your mind, not
your body, that’s causing the problem; if it is your body, then
take the Flaw: Impediment instead.
Vanilla (1 pt. Flaw)
Oh my gods, you’re such an innocent! In a world filled
with sex magick and power plays, you’re the little lamb who’s
strayed far away from home. Jokes get past you, clues escape
you, and references to anything rawer than a Disney flick go
straight over your head. Maybe you grew up in a secluded place
with overprotective parents; or you could be in denial about
the things you see all around you because life can’t possibly be
that twisted… can it? Regardless, hold firm to your innocence.
Once it’s gone, it ain’t never coming back again!
Whimsy (1 pt. Flaw)
You get silly under stress. It’s an avoidance tactic, and while
such behavior can be endearing in small doses, your whimsical
streak can get kinda annoying after a while, especially for folks
who have to deal with you pulling out hand puppets in the
middle of an argument or tossing grapes down your covenmate’s
cleavage when she’s trying to have a serious conversation with
you. In especially stressful situations, you might need to make
a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) to not clown around. Hey, you
can’t help it, right, if you’re trying to lighten the mood? Jeeze,
why does magick have to be so damned serious…?
Amnesia (2 pt. Flaw)
Life before Awakening remains a mystery to you. Friends?
Family? Mundane existence? Whoever and whatever they were,
you cannot recall. This amnesia might be related to PTSD,
fugue-state dissociative Derangement (Mage 20, pp. 648-649),
brain-trauma, Quiet, Social Processing (as shown in thePrelude
for Mage 20), psychic assault (see Uncanny Influence in How
Do You DO That?, pp. 114-136), Things Man Was Not Meant
to Know, or other forms of identity disruption. Regardless of
the reason, being a mage is all you can remember.
Beyond all of the obvious complications involved in
near-total amnesia (lack of memories, social disorientation, legal
nonexistence, a fractured sense of self, and so on), this Flaw also
allows you to take up to five points in “mystery Flaws.” Your
Storyteller will know what they are, but you won’t. Throughout
the chronicle, she’ll spring them on you in various entertaining
ways. Perhaps when all is revealed, you’ll be able to buy off this
Flaw (or have it “paid off” by the Storyteller, in lieu of experience points), and then remember who you were. Whether
or not you’ll like the answers, of course, remains to be seen…
Curiosity (2 pt. Flaw)
You simply can’t resist a good mystery! A nagging sense of
curiosity drags you into all kinds of sticky situations. Given your
abilities, you’ve got a decent chance at finding things out, too…
which is not, especially in the World of Darkness, an especially
healthy thing to do. Isn’t that just like a damn mage, anyway?
When confronted with an enticing clue or enigmatic circumstance, make a Wits roll to avoid giving in to temptation.
The difficulty for that roll depends upon the situation: a casual
mystery (like, say, the identity of that intriguing girl behind the
counter at Starbucks) would be difficulty 5, while resisting a
more compelling sort of mystery (like the identity of the person
who dropped off a dozen roses at your Chantry house) wouldChapter One: Heroic Traits 49
be difficulty 9. Once you’re on the trail, few things short of a
deadly threat will make you stop… and said deadly threat might
simply encourage you to dig even deeper.
Icy (2 pt. Flaw)
You are one ice-cold bastard – an assassin, gangbanger, sociopath, or sadist who can commit atrocities without the slightest
twitch. Although you’re not necessarily insane (see the Derangements in Mage 20, pp. 649-650), your callousness marks you as
a creepy motherfucker. People avoid you unless they’ve got killing
that needs doing… and then they step back and let you do your
thing. Room 101 has positions for people like you (and so, despite
their good-guy façade, do the Traditions and Disparate groups),
but no one truly trusts you, and your soul is definitely in peril,
with the Fallen only a step or two away from owning your cold ass.
Intemperate (2 pt. Flaw)
Everything you do, you do to excess. Oh, sure, you can
(usually) resist the urge to be terminally stupid, but moderation
isn’t part of your vocabulary. Having a drink? Why not have
six? A hand of cards? Why not bet your next paycheck on the
outcome? From expressing opinions to risking body and soul,
you play chicken with life and expect the other guy to swerve.
Folks expect this sort of thing from Ecstasy Cultists, but most
Ecstatics actually have a better sense of their limits than you do.
Whenever you happen to be doing something that probably
won’t result in criminal charges or immediate death, make a
Willpower roll to resist the urge to go whole-hog. The difficulty
for the roll depends on the likely consequences of excess; taking
little risks means difficulty 8 or 9, while risks with life-threatening
potential are easier to resist (difficulty 5 or 6)… though you’ve
been known to go too far in that department, too!
Obsession (2 pt. Flaw)
An all-consuming interest of yours tends to overshadow
whatever passes, in your mind, for common sense. If you love
Star Wars, then you’ve seen all the movies many times over, own
tons of merchandise, and spend inordinate amounts of time
arguing about SW trivia. Is Tarot your obsession? Then you’ve
got dozens (if not hundreds) of decks, research every potential
element of Tarot significance, and drive your friends crazy with
constant offers of readings and advice. You can’t have just one
or two cats – you’re the local Crazy Cat Person who drops half
a paycheck on food, litter, and veterinary bills. This obsession
probably won’t get you killed or anything (unless you’re crazy
enough to get obsessive about werecritters or similarly fatal
topics), but it consumes vast amounts of time, attention, and
cash. When faced with an opportunity to pursue your obsession
down unexplored avenues, or if that obsession interferes with
important things like relationships, work or both, you may50 The Book of Secrets
need to make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) to suppress the
urge. And if the obsession involves something that’s compulsive
by nature – gambling, for example – the Willpower roll could
involve a difficulty of 8 or maybe higher before you can shake
off your compulsion and focus on something else.
Phobia (2 or 3 pt. Flaw)
Irrational terror grips you whenever you face the subject of
your Phobia: crowds, heights, Black Suits, and so forth. Such
terror probably stems from psychic trauma, Social Processing,
or some other incident that carved its niche within your mind.
Although mages pride themselves upon their strength of will,
everybody’s got their weaknesses; this primal fear is one of yours.
The subject of your Phobia must be defined at the time this
Flaw is selected. Anytime you’re confronted with that situation,
make a Willpower roll or else flee that fearsome situation. Even if
you do succeed, you’ll need to roll at least three successes in order
to approach the object of your fears and deal with it head-on. The
Storyteller bases the difficulty of that roll upon the circumstances
of the encounter. An unexpected brush with a normal wolf spider
would rate a difficulty of 6 or 7 for an arachnophobe, while being
dropped into a pit full of titanic wolf spiders would be, shall we
say, somewhat higher. (Difficulty 9 or 10, you poor bastard.)
This Flaw has a three-point variation when applied to vampires and werekin; mages, however, are not subject to uncanny
frenzies the way such creatures are, and so the Flaw is worth
only two points to a mage or other non-frenzying character.
As an optional rule, the Storyteller may allow a character with
the Berserker Merit or the Stress Atavism or Beast Within
Flaws (pp. 53 and 92) to take this Flaw for three points, with
the character freaking out and destroying everything in her way
as she tries to escape if and when the Willpower roll is failed.
PTSD (2 to 5 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, p. 647-648.
Rose-Colored Glasses (2 pt. Flaw)
Known sardonically asRose-Colored Mirrorshadesamong
Technocracy operatives, this Flaw reflects a rather delusional
loyalty to your faction of choice. Essentially, your team can
do no wrong as far as you’re concerned. Their cause is just,
their paradigm unshakable, their deeds necessary under the
circumstances, no matter how extreme those deeds might be.
Your character views almost anything the group does in its most
favorable light… which, considering how awful Awakened groups
can be, means that you’re choosing to overlook a great deal.
Confronted with inconvenient truths, you can get downright
irrational, abusive, or even fanatical. If you’re ever confronted
with truths you cannot deny, avoid, or slander away, the shock
could devastate you for years to come – very possibly driving
you into the arms of a diametrically opposed faction for which
you’ll hold a similar sort of loyalty. (See Changing Focus and
Allegiance in Mage 20, p. 339.)
Vengeful (2 pt. Flaw)
They’ve hurt you, and now they’ll pay!Someone has committed
a crime you cannot and will not forgive, and whenever you get
the chance, you’ll shower them with red-hot vengeance. This
grudge has become your highest priority in life – everything else
is merely a distraction. You may put this quest for revenge aside
temporarily if you spend a Willpower point in order to do so.
Until the guilty parties have been punished, though, vengeance
drives you to become that most dangerous of creatures: a mage
on a mission that ends only with blood.
Short Fuse (2 pt. Flaw)
Anger management is not your strong suit. When something or someone pisses you off (which happens with distressing
regularity), you must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) or
else deal with that shit gloves-off style. You probably won’t
use deadly (or vulgar) force too recklessly, as you’re not long
for this world if you do. Your infamous temper, however, can
have severe long-term effects on your popularity, health, and
status among your peers and superiors… which is itself a lethal
proposition among members of the Technocratic Union and
other groups that pride themselves on self-control.
For a more extreme version of this Trait, see the Supernatural Flaw: Beast Within.
Absent-Minded (3 pt. Flaw)
Um… what was that thing you were trying to remember,
again? Damn… This Flaw reflects a scatterbrained sense of
memory and connection – nothing quite as dangerous as full
Derangement (Mage 20, pp. 648-650), but a distressing and
occasionally hazardous disconnection nonetheless.
System-wise, your Storyteller will often have you make
Intelligence rolls to recall things like names, faces, mission
details, and so forth. Story-wise, you’re forever drawing blanks,
mistaking people for other folks, scrambling data, leaving
projects half-finished (or totally abandoned), forgetting to
feed your familiar, and making potentially hazardous errors
in judgment. Although you won’t forget vital things like your
name, the elements of your magickal focus, or vital character
Traits (Talents, Abilities, and Knowledges), other stuff slips
your mind with frustrating regularity. And when that mind
commands the powers of True Magick, such slips can have
fatal consequences.
Bigot (3 pt. Flaw)
You really fucking hatethose people, whoever “those people”
happen to be. Those people probably don’t like you either. Okay,
maybe you don’t make your feelings obvious, but your conviction
that those people are inferior troublemakers who are Everything
Wrong with the World Goddammit comes through in your
actions and decisions even if you say nothing of the kind out
loud. Such prejudices determine your choice of friends and
enemies, guide your beliefs, influence your politics, and tend
to spill out at inconvenient times if you lose your temper. (SeeChapter One: Heroic Traits 51
Short Fuse, above.) You might end up changing your mind
someday, but for the moment, bigotry is the lens through which
you view your world… and especially for mages, that sort of
thing means quite a bit to the world at large.
Despite the conventional (and not inaccurate) view of bigots
as raging racists, sexists, and homophobes, supposedly liberal
people can be bigots too; the worst kinds of bigots, in fact, are
often self-righteous folks whose claims of open-mindedness
get undercut by a quiet yet implacable prejudice against those
people. Older versions of this Flaw rated it at only two points;
in the twenty-first century, however, bigotry is more likely to
get you in trouble if and when it’s revealed, especially on the
Internet or in mass media… unless, of course, you’re running
for president, or otherwise speaking up for folks who share
your views, in which case you become a saint to some people
and a demon to others.
It’s worth noting that bigots tend to have understandable
reasons for their prejudices. Those reasons could stem from
personal grievances, cultural bias, racial anxieties, scriptural
proclamations, psychic trauma, gender clashes, philosophical
paradigms, and – especially within Mage’s world – physical
and metaphysical distinctions between “us” and “them.” Those
reasons probably seem like bullshit to most people, but remain
perfectly justified to the bigot in question.
It’s also worth noting that this Flaw should not in any way
be taken as a license to abuse your fellow players. As with other mature-audience subjects, a character’s prejudices might become a
trigger for real-life tensions within the group, and should thus
be handled carefully, as described under the Problems and
Triggers sections of Mage 20, pp. 344-345.
Chronic Depression (3 pt Flaw)
Regardless of your external circumstances, you often feel
drawn toward despair. Everything seems overwhelming, pointless, and at best a fucking joke at the world’s expense. That
feeling pervades each aspect of your existence: your attitude,
your physical health, your relationships, and even – especially!
– your approach to magick and all its manifestations. (See the
Mage 20sections aboutFocus and the Arts,Resonance,Quiet,
and the Vidare perceptions of the Otherworlds.) TL/DR: It
really sucks to be you.
Often viewed as a purely psychological issue (“It’s all in
your pretty little head…”), chronic depression tends to be linked
to physiological Impediments, as in the Physical Flaw of that
name. This Flaw can also reflect the psychic aftermath of Paradox
backlashes, Quiet episodes, Things Man Was Not Meant to
Know, Mind-Sphere attacks, and other forms of trauma (breakups, violation, disaster, and the like), although trauma-induced
depression is most often a manifestation of the Flaw: PTSD,
referenced above. Regardless of its origins, the psychological
element of depression is inescapable. The emotional weight of
constant despair tends to sap physical vitality, which comes back
around and inspires more depression. No wonder chronically
depressed people have a hard time “living life to the fullest.”
On some days, just getting out of bed without falling into a
crying heap is a challenge.
Story-wise, this Flaw influences roleplaying and character
descriptions as suggested above. System-wise, it often requires
you to make a Willpower roll when your depressed character
needs to push himself beyond the depression. A successful roll
means that he acts without hindrance. A failed one adds +2 to
the difficulty of the primary task at hand, which could involve
Attributes from the Physical (depression drains vitality), Social
(undercuts relationships with other folks), or Mental (mental
fuzz) categories, depending upon the situation. A botched roll
means that the depression takes over and drops him into a
deep black pit of despair in which he’ll be stuck for hours or
even days at a time.
You can spend a Willpower point to shove depression
aside, avoiding this roll entirely. However, as anyone who
understands the analogy of spoons can attest, sooner or later
you run out of Willpower points. (For those who are not
familiar with the analogy, it’s the idea that you have a limited
number of spoons to use each day; every task demands that
you give up one spoon, and so you soon run out of spoons).
The fact that people tend to get frustrated with your Black
Cloud of Doom™ doesn’t exactly help matters much; hell,
you’re more frustrated with that shit than anybody else is!
So seriously – in all aspects of one’s life, Chronic Depressiontown is not a fun place to be… not even for fans of the
World of Darkness.
Deranged (3 or 5 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, p. 648-650.
Driving Goal (3 pt. Flaw)
Even by Awakened standards, you possess (or are possessed
by) a cause so intense that it drives every aspect of your life, up
to and including your beliefs about, and approach to, magick
and Ascension. This goal, sadly, is almost impossible to achieve
on an individual basis: the collapse of the Technocracy, the
return of the Old Ways, the fall of the industrialized era, and
so forth. As a mage, you actually could gather enough influence
to lead a larger movement that shifts Reality toward your goal.
More likely, you will break yourself against that goal, as so
many other mages have done before you… but hey, if a cause
is as worth fighting for as yours is, then it’s worth whatever
cost you must pay.
As a Flaw, this Driving Goal inspires roleplaying choices and informs your character’s focus, allegiance, magick,
Path, Resonance, Seekings, Paradox backlashes, and pretty
much everything else you can imagine. You can take short
breaks from your crusade (usually by spending a Willpower point in order to take a different road for a while), but
eventually this obsession brings you back to the goal you
must pursue at all costs until you finally accomplish it or
destroy yourself trying.52 The Book of Secrets
Extreme Kink (3 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Everyone’s a little kinky; your needs are more, shall we say,
exotic than a run-of-the-mill fetish. You might still adhere to the
third part of the BDSM mantra safe, sane, and consensual, but
your kink is neither safe nor sane by most people’s definition of
those words. We’re not talking about tame bondage-and-spanking
stuff – more like Fifty Shades of What the Fuck is Wrong with You?
Unlike the old Flaw: Sadism /Masochism (which it replaces),
this Flaw isn’t about the nature and specifics of your kink – it’s
about how much trouble you can get into trying to satisfy your
needs. A three-point kink can damage your health, reputation,
and play partners; a four-point kink can seriously harm you
(and whoever’s unfortunate enough to hook up with you), and
a five-point kink can get you prison time or worse. (Gods help
the people you choose to help you satisfy that kink…)
Certain mages are more prone to this Flaw than others,
especially if they favor Left-Hand Path-type practices. For what
ought to be obvious reasons, this is not an appropriate Flaw
for all chronicles or players, and may well invoke safewords and
blackouts from your Storyteller or companions. (See Mage 20,
p. 345.) Although this Flaw, like others of its kind, does not
bear a judgment on our part, this sort of thing can offend and
trigger other players, so don’t be a dick about it.
Feral Mind (3 pt. Flaw)
More animal than human being, you lack the social graces
and mental conditioning that most folks consider essential.
Perhaps you’re a throwback, or wild-raised since childhood; or
maybe you lost a part of yourself to animalistic shapechanging,
suffer from a mental or psychological quirk, or simply renounce
your humanity in favor of a more honest primal truth.
Regardless of its origins, this feral-mindedness limits your
ability to function in human society. You prefer non-linguistic
vocalizations and body language over cultured speech, and may
lack the ability to “speak” in human terms at all. Your actions
and reactions are animalistic too; you mark territory, snarl
when annoyed, cower or lash out when threatened, feel no
sense of so-called “modesty,” detest clothing, and smell musky
even when you’ve just had a bath (which you rarely do under
your own power). Such behaviors usually raise the difficulty of
your social-interaction rolls by +3, although certain situations
– like intimidation or seduction – may lower the difficulty by
the same amount (-3).
This Flaw, however, isn’t simply a social drawback; you
may not have more than three separate Language Merits,
and you speak very little (and very simply) when you choose
to speak at all. Your human developmental skills (speech,
reading, math, socialization, etc.) hover at a child-like level
despite your sharp instincts and innate primal cunning.
Although your Mental Attributes (especially Perception and
Wits) may be high, you probably won’t ever reach an adult
level of human development; even if you do, the animal in
you remains very close to the skin.
Flashbacks (3 pt. Flaw)
Sudden flashes of sensory trauma haunt you constantly.
These might be legacies of psychoactive drug use, visions of
a past or future incarnation, kickbacks from PTSD (see the
Flaw of that name), echoes of Quiet, all-too-vivid memories,
Things Man was Not Meant to Know… in short, they could
be anything that floods your mind with bursts of unexpected
impressions that overwhelm your current circumstances.
High-stress situations can trigger such hallucinations – and
since mages essentially live in high-stress situations, this Flaw can
be a fairly nasty one. The stress in question doesn’t have to be a
bad experience, although itdoestend to be the bad days that bring
such things out in the worst way possible. You might see your
loved one’s face start to melt in a moment of passion… or feel the
branding irons that seared your flesh in a past life burn their way
into your skin during an argument with your boss. Heavy traffic
could become a roller coaster, and the exam you’re taking might
morph into a living page of laughing cartoons. Flashbacks don’t
have to make sense, and they often don’t. They can, however,
blot out your true surroundings unless you successfully make a
Willpower roll (difficulty 8) to shake them off.
Thankfully, flashbacks don’t often last long. By the time
you realize that you’re not dodging HIT Marks in the ruins of
Concordia, though, you may have driven off the road, punched
your best friend, shat your pants, or run like a maniac through
downtown Seattle without realizing that it was all in your head…
this time, anyway.
Hatred (3 pt. Flaw)
As with Bigot, above, you utterly despise some source of
hatred. Maybe you loathe vampires, werebeasts, rich or homeless
people, fae folk, spirits, dogs, trucks, machines, TV, lawyers,
witches, cops, politicians… whatever it is that you hate, you hate
it a lot, and will take advantage of any opportunity to hinder
or harm the object of your hostility.
Like a bigot, you have what you consider to be a perfectly
rational reason for hating whatever it is you despise. Other folks
probably consider you crackers unless they share your point
of view – in which case, they might become disciples instead.
(See the Backgrounds: Allies, Backup, Cult, Influence and
Retainers.) As with aDriving Goal, this Flaw guides roleplaying
choices, determines targets, and makes you seem rather obsessive whenever the object of aversion comes into play. Because
fear and hatred are so closely intertwined, chances are good
that you’ve got a Short Fuse and /or a Phobia related to this
Flaw. And if you also have Berserker /Stress Atavism or Beast
Within, then you need to make a Willpower roll (difficulty 8)
when confronted head-on with the thing you abhor, or else
lose your proverbial shit in its general direction.
Obviously, this Flaw must be chosen carefully. If your character tends to go thermonuclear at, say, the police on an ongoing
basis, he is in for a very rough (and probably short) life indeed.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 53
Lifesaver (3 pt. Flaw)
Life, to you, is a gift and miracle worth saving. As far as you’re
concerned, even the most wretched people are worth another
chance at redemption, and so you go out of your way to save lives
and improve the lot of people (human and otherwise) who need
a leg up in this world. More than a simple “code verses killing,”
this Trait gives you a moral imperative to salvage lives, not just
a reason to not end them. In short, it makes you a big-hearted,
generous person who deeply believes in the sanctity (whether
you would use that religious term or not) of life. And that, in the
World of Darkness, is a magnificent burden to bear.
OCPD (3 pt. Flaw)
Mages tend to be kinda obsessive by nature. You, however,
feel compelled to follow stringent personal rituals, maintain an
obsessive sense of order, work yourself to the point of exhaustion
(and beyond), organize every possible element of your life and
space, employ compulsive behaviors without realizing that you’re
doing so, and otherwise lose track of time, things, and people
unless they fall into the sphere of your obsessive-compulsive
personality disorder.
An especially common Flaw among technomancers, scientists, ritual magi, religious devotees, autistic people, military
personnel, artists, executives, and other folks whose philosophies
and pursuits demand continual attention, OCPD could also
result from various forms of psychic trauma, brain damage,
spiritual epiphanies, cultural or professional perfectionism,
and metaphysical dedication. As a rule, a person’s behaviors
grow more compulsive when he’s under stress. After all, when
it seems like your world’s spinning out of control, it becomes
all the more important to establish control over whatever
elements you can control.
When this Flaw is chosen, you’ll need to define which
compulsions your character has, and figure out the triggers
that make those compulsions more obvious. System-wise, you’ll
often have to make Willpower rolls in order to shake off the
need to organize and obsess over the object of your attentions.
The difficulty, of course, depends upon the situation and the
character’s level of stress at the time; the more challenging the
circumstances, the more obsessive the compulsions.
Stress Atavism (4 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, p. 644, and the Merit: Berserker.
Ability Deficit (5 pt. Flaw)
For whatever reason, you have fallen short of your potential.
Maybe you’re too young to have learned a lot about life (an
excellent reason for a child-mage to have this Flaw); or you’ve
led a sheltered existence, honing your Knowledges but lacking
in Talents. You could be a construct who only recently left the
lab, or too physically frail to have mastered much in the way
of Talents or Skills. There’s certainly some story-based reason
for your deficient Traits, and that cause will have other effects
on the chronicle as well.
In game terms, this Flaw subtracts five points from one
of your Ability categories (Talents, Skills, or Knowledges),
and limits your starting Traits in that category to three dots
or fewer even if /when you spend freebie points to raise them.
(You may, of course, raise them after the chronicle has begun.)
As noted above, this makes a good Flaw for Awakened kids,
constructs, and other folks who haven’t been able to “be all
that you can be” just yet.
For details about young mages, seeChild-MagesinChapter
Two, pp. 115-116.
Social Merits
Although mages aren’t always among the most sociable
of creatures, certain Awakened folk lean heavily upon the
company of friends and fellow-travelers. And so, Merits that
help a character move more easily through social circles can be
pretty valuable. Especially in the twenty-first century, a mage
of any sort can use all the friends they can get.
Loyalty (1 pt. Merit)
You’re especially devoted to a certain cause, group, creed
or person. When someone tries to turn you against the object
of your loyalty, you receive a two-die bonus to your dice pool
when resisting that attempt with your Willpower. If the assault
uses your Willpower Trait as the difficulty for the attack, then
your attacker adds +2 to her difficulty while striving to undermine your loyalty. (See the feat Resisting on the Dramatic
Feats chart in Mage 20, p. 403, and the Mind Sphere entry
in the same book, p. 519.)
Naturally, you must define the source and reasons for your
devotion when you select this Merit. Such loyalty will influence
many of your roleplaying choices too – your friends, enemies,
priorities, magickal focus, and other things besides. For extra
fun (ha ha), you can complement this Merit with the Flaw:
Conflicting Loyalties, described below.
Family Support (1 to 3 pt. Merit)
Your family knows about your Awakened life – and for the
most part, they approve of it. You might belong to an ancestral
“fam trad” (a family tradition of magical /occult pursuits), a
supportive New Ager-type of clan, an appropriately religious
family (that is, relatives who follow the same creed as you do),
a wealthy dynasty that backs your current life-choices, and so
on. This family could be your proverbial “family of origin”
(your blood relations), an adopted “family of choice” (people
who are not your genetic kin but who function as your family
now), or both. Either way, your family stands behind you. This
Merit doesn’t extend to major economic help unless you also
purchase the appropriate Backgrounds too (Resources, Retainers, and so on). Still, it’s good to have someplace to call home,
and someone to be there when you need them.
The more influential your family, and the more supportive
of you they are, the more this Merit costs:54 The Book of Secrets
• (1 point) You’ve got a “typical” family for your culture,
and their support is mostly emotional although you can
get a few bucks, a favor, and a place to crash when you
need it.
• (2 points) Your family has status, wealth, and influence.
While they expect you to stand on your own for the most
part, you can still get help if and when you need some.
• (3 points) A scion of wealth, power, and privilege, you
can call upon favors and influence when need be. Your
clan pulls strings on your behalf even when you don’t
ask for help, and people defer to you because of your
heritage.
As anyone who’s been born into a wealthy yet dysfunctional clan can attest, you can have both Family Support and
Family Issues (as the Flaw described below). Your rich dad
could be an abusive prick, your loving uncle might be creepily
possessive, and Mom’s support comes with more strings than
a puppeteer’s convention. Both Traits could also represent a
character whose family of origin is a mess, but whose family
of choice supports her.
For the purposes of coincidental magick, a family reflected
in this Merit does not count as Sleeper witnesses when their
beloved mage casts Effects. That benefit doesn’t usually extend
to your companions, however, unless they employ the same
sort of focus as you do, use magick that fits into your family’s
world-view, or purchase this Merit to reflect being “adopted”
into your family as a childhood friend, a spouse, or an otherwise
beloved part of the clan.
Favor (1 to 3 pt. Merit)
Also known as a Boon, this Merit means that somebody owes you, big-time. You scratched their back, and will
eventually call in some scratching of your own in due time.
Maybe you aided a Master-level mage… or helped a vampire
prince… or did a solid for a wealthy Sleeper, a spirit, a faerie,
or a ranking member of the Changing Breeds. Regardless
of their identity, this party is more powerful than you are,
and can get things done on your behalf that you could not
get done yourself.
The value of this Merit depends upon the value of that
favor. Minor acts of benevolence cost one point, significant
boons are worth two, and a life-debt is worth three. You
may purchase several Favors, either from a single party
or from several different folks who owe you. A Storyteller
may grant this Merit in place of experience points if your
character has helped a supporting character and requested,
earned or demanded a Favor in return. Once that favor has
been performed, however, the Merit is spent. Long-lasting
assistance would be counted as a Background like Mentor
or Patron, or as one of the allies described in the section
about Supernatural Merits.
Pitiable (1 pt. Merit)
Oh, you poor thing! People want to help you, and you’re
willing to let them do so. Although this Merit lowers the
difficulty of your social rolls by -2 when you’re trying to get
someone to take care of you, it adds +2 to the difficulty of rolls
that attempt to intimidate people or otherwise impress folks
into taking you seriously.
Prestigious Mentor (1 pt. Merit)
Your Mentor (as in the Background Trait of that name)
has a reputation that benefits you as well. When you’re making social rolls to invoke your influential teacher, reduce the
difficulty by -2. Of course, some folks will be somewhat less
than impressed; for rolls that involve rivals or enemies of your
mentor, add +2 to the difficulty unless that mentor scares the
shit out of them… in which case, you had damned well better
be able to live up to the fear his name invokes!
Regal Bearing (1 pt. Merit)
Aristocratic charisma is your birthright. Although you
might not actually hail from a noble family, your presence radiates dignity. Posture, features, tone of voice, aura of dominion
– you’re got them all. People defer to you as a reflex; subtract
-2 from the difficulty of your Social-Trait rolls whenever you’re
trying to make an impression, and while certain folks will want
to take you down a few pegs on general principle, most people
are inclined to respect you even if they don’t necessarily like you.
Unobtrusive (1 pt. Merit)
You can pass without notice in most social situations. This
is less about the uncanny Background: Arcane (although it can
complement that Background) than it is a matter of simply
seeming unremarkable. Unless you make a fuss of some kind,
folks just don’t remember you. You’re… um, that dude… or
that girl… or, well, damn, I don’t even remember exactly what
sort of person you are, actually. And in some lines of work or
walks of life, this is a very useful talent to have.
Although it does not in any way render you invisible or
untraceable, this Merit lets you blend in and slip from memory.
Folks need to make a Perception roll (difficulty 6) in order to
recall your features or name. On the flipside, you add +2 to the
difficulty of any social rolls you need to make, because folks
just don’t notice you under most circumstances. For obvious
reasons, you can’t take any socially distinctive Merits, Flaws or
Backgrounds – such Traits would make you memorable – or have
especially distinctive features or clothing. Granted, “distinctive”
depends upon who and where you are; the proverbial gray flannel
suit, for example, stands out at places like Burning Man! Under
most circumstances, though, you blend in wherever you go.
Animal Magnetism (2 pt. Merit)
Though it might not involve conventionally good looks, you
possess a primal sort of attractiveness. Your social rolls subtract
-2 from their difficulty when you’re trying to charm, seduce, orChapter One: Heroic Traits 55
otherwise impress folks by appealing to their carnal natures.
This benefit doesn’t usually apply to threats or intimidation
attempts, although clever applications of raw sex appeal can be
rather unnerving, which could facilitate rather effective threats…
Confidence (2 pt. Merit)
You exude an aura of unshakable authority. Nothing seems
to rattle you. Folks defer to you by default, and you expect
nothing less. Even when you’re making things up off the top
of your head, or lying your ass off about your true feelings or
intentions, your self-confidence inspires an unusual degree of
trust. Cool is your middle name, and the few people who try to
get one over on you have a very hard time doing so.
When dice start falling, subtract -2 from the difficulty of
all social rolls based upon impressing other characters with your
capabilities. Other players, however – the Storyteller included
– add +2 to the difficulty of social rolls for characters who try
to shake your confidence or shatter your calm.
Hideaway /Safehouse (2, 4 or 6 pt. Merit)
When you need time to yourself, there’s a place you can
go to that no one knows about except you. It’s small, yeah,
and remote enough that your friends and enemies can’t find
you there. Chances are, it’s a secret apartment or condo, a
distant cottage, a mobile home, or a literal cave or grove or
camping spot where you go to escape the stress of your usual
life. It could even be a pocket Realm, accessible only to you
and whomever you choose to share it with, should you be
foolish enough to trust anyone else with this secret hideaway.
Unless you give its location away, however, or wind up getting
tracked to it by a dedicated stalker, this little getaway is your
personal escape hatch. Use it wisely, and be careful when
you come and go!
Unlike the Merit:Property(see below), or the Backgrounds:
Chantry,Node, andSanctum, this discrete hidey-hole isn’t expansive, elaborate, or innately magickal. That said, it’s hidden from
most forms of casual detection. You could combine this Merit
with Property, Node or Sanctum, although those Traits would
need to be purchased in addition to your Hideaway, and their
existence must remain secret from other characters. Chantries
are social by default, and so cannot also become a Hideaway.
This place is stocked up with whatever you would need for a
roughly two-week stay, and may, of course, be stocked up for
longer periods if you bring in additional supplies. Although you
might be traced to your hideaway with magick or other tracking
methods, your little retreat is not linked to you by any searchable
official channels: bills, lease, mail, Internet services, etc.
Once per story – if events occur which could lead other
people to your hideaway, if you do something that could
reveal its location, or if someone dedicates time and effort56 The Book of Secrets
trying to track you down – the Storyteller may roll two dice
against difficulty 6. (Yes, this roll is done in secret, so you
won’t know the results.) If that roll gets at least one success,
then your secret remains hidden; one failure means that
someone has gotten a clue but not your exact whereabouts;
four successive failures reveal the location of your hideaway,
and a botch on that roll exposes its location immediately. So
long as you continue to cover your tracks, however, this place
remains yours and yours alone.
For four points, this Merit could also be purchased under the name Safehouse. In this case, it’s a secured getaway
that features better facilities and protections than a typical
Hideaway. Its store of supplies can provide for a dozen or
so people for roughly two months, and the Merit includes
a small dedicated staff (in game terms, two dots in Retainers or four dots in Backup) to maintain that site. Unlike a
Hideaway, this area can withstand a minor-league assault,
and features up to three offices /work areas, reinforced
walls, bulletproof glass, and a vault-like panic room. This
safehouse also includes a shielded communications array
(-2 to attempts to hack or trace that system), and a simple
but effective alarm and security camera system (again, -2 to
subversion attempts). The downside is that the Merit is not
your property; it belongs to your superiors, and can be taken
away from you if you fall out with the folks who foot the bill
for it. Generally, a Technocrat in good standing with her
superiors can get a Safehouse Merit (or, for especially good
service, be awarded with one), but other mages could obtain
a similar facility as well.
For six points, your refuge can be both a Safehouse and
a Hideaway; in this case, the property belongs entirely to you.
Enjoy your Batcave, Mr. Wayne!
Natural Leader (2 pt. Merit)
Inspiring by nature, you’re the sort of person other people
look to for guidance. As a result, your Leadership-based dice
pools receive a two-die bonus. Obviously, you need a certain
level of presence to inspire such loyalty, and so you must have
three dots or more in your Charisma Attribute before you can
hope to be such a commanding individual.
Officially Dead (2 pt. Merit)
According to the authorities, you’re no longer among
the living. Perhaps you’ve successfully faked your own death,
or had it faked for you when you assumed a new identity. An
especially common Merit among Technocratic operatives, Hermetic magi, and the Chakravanti, this erasure of your former
life is often a required part of service within the New World
Order, Iteration X, and certain Houses of Hermes. As far as
your family, government, and old friends are concerned, you’re
six feet under. Naturally, you’ll need to be discreet about your
continued existence if you don’t want that death to become
more permanent.
Perfect Liar (2 pt. Merit)
Oh gods, you’re good at lying! Falsehoods slide from your
tongue like water off a vine leaf, and even the folks who know
you well tend to be taken in when you start talking. You also
lack the usual “tells” that betray a liar: your vital signs remain
stable, your eyes don’t twitch, and your voice never falters.
Unless someone is outright reading your mind (as in, using
Mind-Sphere magick or some other paranormal power), you still
often appear to be telling the truth; even then, the mind-reader
might assume that you at least believe you’re telling the truth!
Story-wise, people usually believe what you say when you’re
lying about small, casual things that are not immediately, obviously false. With regards to the dice, reduce the difficulty by -2
when you’re trying to lie about something important. Again,
this Merit will not alter auras or change the thoughts in your
head, although those folks who can’t actively monitor your soul
will be inclined to give you the benefit of the doubt. (Suckers…)
Prestige (2 pt. Merit)
Also known as Reputation, this Merit reveals you as an
honored personage within your Tradition, Convention, Craft,
or another sort of sect. Among your peers, you add three extra
dice to all social rolls used to influence folks within that group.
Story-wise, allies of your group will tend to like you, and rivals
or enemies will tend to… not.
When you first select this Merit, decide upon the source
of this prestige. Perhaps you earned it through deeds before the
chronicle began, or won the Merit in place of experience points.
It might represent an honored lineage to which you belong,
or reflect a glorious mentor whose rep rubs off on you. Either
way, folks expect great things of you, and usually defer to you
so long as you live up to the reputation you currently enjoy.
For the flipside of this Merit, see the Social Flaw: Infamy,
pp. 62-63.
Property (2 to 5 pt. Merit)
You’ve got a decent-sized piece of property that, while
non-magickal, is certainly useful: a manor house, a farm, a
nightclub, bookstore, restaurant, grove, and so forth. The
larger and more prosperous the property, the more points
this Merit costs. Elsewhere known as the Merits: Nightclub
and Mansion, this Merit demands a minimum rating in the
Background: Resources, as noted below.
• (2 points) A relatively small property of roughly 3000
square feet /900 meters, with perhaps – if it’s a business
– a trickle of income that slightly exceeds its expenses.
Examples: a nice house, a comic store, a coffee shop, a
penthouse apartment, etc. Minimum Resources: 3
• (3 points) A rather sweet place with dedicated servants
/staffers, all necessary facilities (sewer, trash, Internet
connection, etc.), and – if it’s a business – an income
that contributes to your Resources Background.Examples:Chapter One: Heroic Traits 57
A nightclub, a mansion, a small farm, a radio station, a
large store, and so forth. Minimum Resources: 4
• (4 points) A substantial location, staffed with skilled
(though mundane) employees and connected to an acre
or two of associated land. Examples: A small office building, a family manor, an arena, a school, a medium-sized
farm, a vineyard, a small laboratory, a library, and the
like. At this level, it could also represent several smaller,
two-point Properties as well. Minimum Resources: 5
• (5 points) An impressive holding that features an extensive staff and a fair amount of property. Examples: An
office complex, a stadium, a college, a major laboratory,
a shopping center, an archive, and so forth. This level
could reflect a number of two-point or three-point
Properties, too. Minimum Resources: 6
Although this Merit, by itself, is in no way magickal or hypertech-equipped, your Property could provide the base of operations
for the Backgrounds: Allies, Backup, Chantry, Cult, Library,
Node, Resources, Retainers, Sanctum, and even Spies. (Baristas overhear a lot of crazy stuff…) Unless you’ve got a dedicated
manager for the Property, it also demands a certain amount
of time and attention, and quickly falls into disrepair and /or
bankruptcy if you leave it alone for a week or more while jaunting
off on various adventures. Property also tends to attract interest
from parties both mundane and otherwise, especially if there’s
an ongoing rivalry with competing businesses, family enemies,
an archnemesis, and so on. Cops take a dim view of wild stuff
going down on your property, and the insurance costs can be
murder if (read:when) your place gets trashed by extradimensional
entities, HIT Marks, or raging Ascension Warriors.
Unless they’re part of the Backgrounds: Allies, Backup,
Cult, or Retainers, employees of your Property Merit do count
as Sleeper witnesseswith regards to magickal deeds on and around
such properties.
Research Grant (2 pt. Merit)
You’ve been given a prestigious grant from a foundation,
an academy, a corporation, or some other moneyed institution.
This stipend frees you from the burdens of a regular job, and
although it’s probably not a large amount of money, it’ll keep
you in rent and ramen for a while… so long as you don’t piss
off your sponsors.
This grant also includes a certain degree of privileged
access to archives and facilities that are connected to your field
of endeavor. And yeah – it’s got some strings, too. You need to
report your findings on a regular basis, suck up to the necessary
authorities, and behave in a manner that reflects well upon your
sponsors. In many cases (especially for corporate endowments),
said sucking up includes reporting what your sponsors want
to hear, not necessarily what your research actually reveals.
Failure to please your supporters tends to result in the loss of
said endowment. Isn’t research wonderful?
Sanctity (2 pt. Merit)
Although you might not actually be innocent, you project
an impression of purity. People trust you even if you’re not
trustworthy, and they’re inclined to think of you as some sort
of paragon. Naturally, this can be an almighty pain in the
ass too. When you get in trouble, though (and you will), the
authorities will almost certainly go easy on you, friends will
aid you, and even strangers may come to your defense because
you couldn’t possibly be guilty of what you’re accused of doing!
Secret Code Language (2 pt. Merit)
Language itself is a series of codes; folks who’ve been
initiated into it (that is, folks who’ve learned the language) are
considered members of the society in question. Some languages,
however, are more exclusive and secretive than others. This
Merit reflects your knowledge of a particular code known to
only the “right people.”
Mages are secretive by nature, and so mage society is full of
secret codes. Even Sleepers, though, have their own initiatory
languages: military jargon, the Language of Flowers, various
hand-signals, ciphers, and passwords employed by people who
need to communicate with each other in ways no one outside
their group can understand… except, perhaps, for those who’ve
learned those codes through some “unauthorized” source.
As with the Merit: Language (p. 44), this Merit confers
knowledge of a particular communication mode, which might
not be in any way verbal. It could involve hand-signals, body
postures, artwork, flags, symbolism, numbers, and so on. To
uninitiated observers, that language appears to be gibberish
(a word, incidentally, that refers to the coded writings of the
alchemist Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayyan); in many cases, a coded
method of communication appears completely mundane unless
you know what to look for, as with the encrypted artwork in
The DaVinci Code.
One vital caveat: A character must have a very good in-game
reason for knowing the things she knows. Learning a Secret
Code Language requires some story-based foundation for that
knowledge: elite military training, mind-reading, time among
the group in question, etc. Fortunately, code languages tend to
be utilitarian, revealing essential things in a general manner.
(“I’m hungry,” “Kill him,” “This area’s forbidden,” etc.) Even so,
codes may have subtleties that aren’t readily apparent; a single
gesture or stressed syllable might mark the difference between
Knock him out and move on quickly and Torture him to his least
breath, no matter how long it takes.
Socially Networked (2 pt. Merit)
Well-Connected on the Internet (as in the Virtual Adept
Merit of that name), you enjoy a high online profile – a website, at least one blog, more Twitter followers and Facebook
friends than you could possibly meet in Meatspace, and so on.
When you post, folks read, share, and take it seriously. While
this might or might not translate into folks you know in the58 The Book of Secrets
Digital Web (and really – would you want it to?), you command
global influence via the World Wide Web. As a result, you’ve
got the sort of influence and resources that most folks cannot
imagine: crowdfunding backers, instant information, places
to crash all over the world if and when you want them… the
details depend upon the sort of presence you maintain and
the people you attract, but they go beyond anything you could
accomplish without the Internet.
Of course, you could fuck things up on a grand scale if
you’re not careful – such attention can backfire on you if you
post the wrong thing at the wrong time – and certain haters
despise you on general principle. Considering that the Internet
is a prime front in twenty-first century reality wars, though,
this sort of network can provide a major edge for your side.
Subculture Insider (2 pt. Merit)
You’re innately familiar with a social environment that
most folks never visit, much less understand. They know you
there, and so even when you haven’t met a given person (human
or otherwise) in that environment, they consider you to be an
insider. Thanks to your familiarity, you can navigate certain
elements of the physical environment there too – the security
apparatuses, the “secret handshakes,” the hidden corners that
an insider would know about and an outsider would never think
to look for, and other obstacles that a subculture puts into place
to make certain that only the “right” people can get around.
When moving through your subculture of choice, subtract -2
from the difficulties of rolls that grant social or physical access
to that subculture’s established turf.
The subculture in question can be any kind of exclusive
social environment that also includes the physical surroundings
employed by that particular group: country clubs, drug cartels,
the international mercenary network, the global espionage underworld, high-level finance executives, the fetish community,
homeless transient communities, clannish rural communities,
hip-hop networks, the jet set, rave festival culture, fantasy fans,
the touring road-dog musical community, world financial leaders,
“gypsy” Travelers, and so on. Although it can include mages and
other Night-Folk, the community must be essentially “mortal” in
terms of the majority of insiders. You can buy this Merit several
times to reflect membership in several different communities.
That insider status, however, takes time to acquire and a lot of
attention to maintain. If you neglect your community, you’ll
soon find those familiar doors slammed in your face.
Dark Triad (3 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 643.
Local Hero (3 pt. Merit)
You’ve done great things for your community, and people
love you for it. You might have cleaned out the resident drug
dealers, defied slumlords, established a halfway house or a
center of worship – whatever it was that you did for the Masses,
you get free food, “friends of the house” discounts, places to
crash (possibly with happy bedmates!), and other offerings of
thanks from the people you have helped.
Also known as Folk Hero, this Merit reflects your popularity among the local Sleepers. You reduce the difficulty of
your social rolls by -2 when you’re dealing with the people of
your community, and receive constant aid and respect from
those people whenever you need them. The catch, of course,
is that you must live up to your heroic reputation; turn your
back on these grateful souls, or take their goodwill for granted,
and you’ll be “yesterday’s hero” in no time.
Noted Messenger (3 pt. Merit)
A known emissary between groups, you’re treated with
a certain amount of deference and courtesy that other mages
would not receive. Even enemies of your group won’t try
to kill you on general principle, though they might not be
especially happy to see you. The things you have to say will
be given a certain amount of weight, and your presence may
open doors (literal or otherwise) that would remain shut for
almost anybody else.
That’s the upside; the downside is that you need to behave
yourself (and keep a tight leash on your companions) when
you’re on someone else’s turf. Passing false messages will undermine your credibility, and obnoxious behavior will get that
welcome mat yanked out from under your feet rather quickly.
It should go without saying that breaking a truce while acting
in your official capacity (or even when you’re not!) will trash
your reputation and reflect very poorly on your superiors.
Also… well, some folks really do prefer to kill the messenger
when things don’t go their way. Tread that red carpet carefully.
Rising Star (3 pt. Merit)
Within your group, you’re an up-and-coming luminary.
Your superiors favor you, your peers respect you, handfuls of
haters despise you (of course!), and folks who pay attention
to the group’s activities have noticed your progress, and they
approve. Many people within your group go out of their way to
be your friend, and plum assignments keep coming your way.
When dealing with members of your Tradition, Convention or
whatever, subtract -1 from the difficulties of your social rolls,
unless those rolls are meant to influence folks who want to
see you fail. People are, of course, expecting great things from
you, so don’t let them down…
Ties (3 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, pp. 643-644.
Master of Red Tape (4 pt. Merit)
A savant of bureaucracy, you slash your way through
official obstructionism. When red tape unspools across your
path, you know who to talk to, which forms to fill out, and
where the loopholes are. A few calls to the right people, and
official obstacles disappear as if by magic(k). After all, it’s not
what you ask for but who you ask, and how.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 59
When faced with the near-inevitable morass of bureaucracy, subtract -2 from all difficulties that involve dealing with the
system. To use this Merit, you need to decide what you want
to accomplish and how you want to go about doing that. Your
character makes the requisite calls to the requisite people, and
the dice determine the rest. Backgrounds likeAlternate Identity,
Backup,Certification,Contacts,Influence,Rank,Requisitions,
Retainers, Secret Weapons, and Spies often involve bureaucracies, and Allies, Chantry, Resources, and other Backgrounds
might feature red tape if the Background in question comes from
a larger organization. Although it’s most helpful for members of
the Technocratic Union, any modern mage can find this Merit
useful. Hermetic Chantries are infamous for byzantine bureaucracy, and the courts of classical China pretty much invented
such things, making this an appropriate Merit for Wu Lung and
certain monastic Akashayana.
True Love (4 pt. Merit)
In spite of epic tragedies around you, you’ve found True
Love – the kind that folks make movies, songs, and ballads about.
Whenever things look bleak, Love can pull you through. This
capital-L Love is not defined by gender, culture, anatomy, or
even species… though that last one might make things difficult
for your star-crossed relationship. For extra drama, it could be a
forbidden romance: a cyborg, for example, in love with a Cultist,
or a straight-laced Chorister whose soulmate teeters on the brink of
being Fallen (see also the Flaw: Sleeping with the Enemy, p. 66).
System-wise, this Merit – which exists in a crux between
the Social and Supernatural realms – gives you one automatic
success on all Willpower rolls, which can be negated only by a
botch. (Magick-casting rolls do not apply, although the success
does apply if someone’s trying to influence your character with
Mind magick.) Your True Love will move heaven and earth to
help you, and other folks might do a Princess Bride if and when
they discover that you’ve got True Love on your side. Note,
of course, that said Princess Bride-ism usually involves people
making the Path of True Love even more difficult for you, too.
Such hardships are the reason so many tales revolve around
True Love. You shall, by all the gods, have a very dramatic life…
as per the Chapter Five Genres, Storytelling, and Mage entries
for Romance and Tragedy! (See pp. 285-286.)
Social Flaws
Despite all their enlightenment – and sometimes because
of it – mages can be rather clueless when it comes to social
niceties. Oh, sure, they can be cool as a vampire, smooth as an
oil slick, and more connected than a World Bank conference;
even then, however, a mage can make plenty of gaffes, enemies,
and other social pitfalls. And when that happens, you get stuff
like the following Social Flaws.
Blacklisted (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Having crossed some Powers That Be, you’ve now been
pariah-fied among some segment of the Masses. The results
impact your employment potential, social standing, legal status,
credit rating, background checks, rental possibilities, and other
significant elements of existing in the everyday world.
Originally presented as an Adversarial Background forCertification, this Flaw affects your regional, national, and perhaps
international official status. The degree to which you’ve been
professionally shunned depends upon the value of this Flaw:
• (1 point) Trivial – poor driving record, suspected shoplifter, banned from a local union.
• (2 points) Minor – misdemeanor criminal record, suspended license.
• (3 points) Significant – disbarred lawyer, defrocked clergy,
unpopular political affiliation, dishonorable military
discharge.
• (4points) Major – convicted felon, registered sex offender,
government watch-list, revoked medical license.
• (5 points) Pariah – FBI’s most-wanted, suspected terrorist,
convicted pedophile, declared legally incompetent or insane.
A four- or five-point Blacklisting will also wind up in the
Technocracy’s supervision database – a very dangerous place
for a mage to be! And although the Awakened don’t typically
check in with mundane authorities before recruiting or making
alliances with their own kind, a mage who’s had major problems
with such authorities is likely to have problems with mages too…
especially if such problems include offenses like terrorism or
pedophilia, which certain mages take very, very poorly.
Compulsive Speech (1 to 2 pt. Flaw)
Dude, please just shut up! But no, you just keep talking…
and talking… and talking some more. This compulsion could
come from a nervous social habit, a know-it-all personality, a
sense of awkwardness in silence, or some other (potentially
metaphysical) urge to fill up space with words. Worse still, those
words often feature rude observations, sensitive information,
and other stuff that’s best left unsaid. Day-um – did you just
say what I think you just said? Yep. You did. Arg…
As far as this Flaw is concerned, the one-point version
means you run at the mouth too much, while the two-point
one (also known as Big Mouth) means you say the wrong things
to the wrong people on a fairly regular basis, often to people
who sit higher than you do on the proverbial totem pole, or
who do not exactly have your best interests at heart. You can
spend a Willpower point to keep your mouth shut for a scene
or two; sooner or later, though, the words start flowing again…
Conflicting Loyalties (1 to 3 pt. Flaw)
Though deeply loyal (probably to the point of having the
Merit: Loyalty – see p. 53), you’re facing a crisis of commitments: two or more of the parties you feel loyal to are at odds
with one another, and you’re caught in the middle trying to60 The Book of Secrets
support them all. Your best friend could be in trouble with
the police force your father worked for; your lover may have
betrayed the trust of your Convention; your Allies may have
decided that your Mentor has to go. And so there you are –
poised in an impossible situation, attempting to do the right
thing for everyone involved.
The value of this Flaw, as always, depends upon the intensity of the conflict:
• (1 point) A minor crisis forces you to shuttle between
loyalties while remaining true to all parties.
• (2 points) A significant clash leads you to mediate untenable situations with frustrating frequency.
• (3 points) Irreconcilable differences will eventually
compel you to choose between loyalties, and that’s not a
choice you’re sure you can make. Until that time, you’re
fighting an apparently doomed campaign to support all
sides without betraying anyone.
The nature of your loyalties, relationships, and disputes
should, of course, be worked out when you take this Flaw. Your
Storyteller will make sure to bring them into play often enough
to keep you scrambling for the best solution to an apparently
impossible dilemma.
Conniver (1 pt. Flaw)
As far as most folks who know you are concerned, you’re a
perpetual knife in someone else’s back. That rep might not be
accurate (see the Flaws:Cultural Other,Infamy,Troublemaker,
and Profiled Appearance), but people expect treachery from
you even if they’re wrong to think so. Subtract one die from
any non-magickal dice pool you employ when you’re trying to
get other characters to trust you. This penalty does not extend
to Arete dice pools when you’re casting Mind-Sphere magick
(or any other Sphere’s magick, for that matter), but if you’re
having to cast spells in order to be believed, then you’ve kinda
just lived up to that reputation.
Cultural Other (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
In the eyes of your society, you’re clearly divergent. Disreputable. Other. People suspect you of criminal, or at least
unsavory, behavior; the authorities harass or detain you for little
or no reason, and your loved ones probably “wish you could
just be like normal people.” Granted, every mage is “other” to
some degree. In your case, though, the othering threatens your
life, liberty, and happiness.
Also known as Mistreated Minority, this Flaw reflects
prejudice within your society. The amount of trouble it causes, and the frequency of said trouble, determines the value of
your Flaw:
• (1 point) Folks around you tend to harass you in small
but noticeable ways (acting uncommonly brusque, using
slurs in your presence, taking uncomfortable liberties
with your privacy, property or person, etc.) and seem to
feel there’s nothing wrong with that at all. Other people
might stand up for you, but more often than not they
won’t.
• (2 points) As above, but now your family and other intimate companions feel that you deserve to be avoided,
shamed, insulted, and so forth because you are who or
what you are.
• (3 points) Strangers feel free to shame, insult, avoid,
and perhaps physically attack you on general principle.
Authorities might intervene, but probably won’t do so
unless major laws are broken… and maybe not even
then.
• (4 points) Authorities discriminate against you too. Your
house may be searched, your job may be terminated,
you might be evicted, robbed or assaulted and very few
people will care.
• (5 points) Merely living in this society is physically,
socially, emotionally, and legally hazardous to your
safety, your sanity, and possibly your life. You could be
imprisoned, enslaved, tortured or killed with little-or-no
response from the authorities.
Unlike the physical Flaw: Profiled Appearance, this
discrimination isn’t based on physicality. A character with
this Flaw cannot also take the Profiled Appearance Flaw; if your
character stands out physically while also being discriminated
against socially, simply take more points in this Flaw.
Nor is this Flaw tied to any particular creed, gender or
ethnicity; while a Wiccan could be a Cultural Other in a town
filled with fundamentalist Baptists, a fundamentalist Baptist
could be a Cultural Other in a Wicca-based Horizon Realm.
You could follow a “heretical” creed, belong to a “disreputable”
subculture, identify as a sexual /gender /ethnic /religious “minority,” hold an unpopular political opinion… anything that
inspires others around you to treat you poorly and get away
with it could be considered grounds for this Flaw.
That said, a character with this Flaw must indeed be treated poorly; having folks call you out on an unpopular opinion,
or criticize your behavior, is part of the human experience,
whereas having cops shake you down merely for existing is an
actual problem. In order to take this Flaw, your character must
face actual discrimination and attack on a fairly regular and
hazardous basis. No, being called names on the Internet does
not count, although an intense bout of cyberbullying – that
is, doxing, swatting, career destruction, and serious threats to
life and sanity – might count as this Flaw, at the Storyteller’s
discretion.
Because Cultural Other is tied to the character’s social
surroundings, a radical change to those surroundings may
mitigate or eliminate this Flaw. A polyamorous person may beChapter One: Heroic Traits 61
discriminated against in one city, and welcomed with open arms (and
open legs) in another; if that poly character remains in poly-friendly surroundings, then the player needs to buy off or replace this Flaw. Similarly,
your “otherness” must be either something that people know about, or
something that they could find out about easily enough for that element
of your life to become a big problem for you. A deeply hidden “otherness”
is a Dark Secret (see below) until or unless it gets revealed.
To be clear: This Flaw in no way reflects judgment on the part of this
game, its creators, or – one hopes! – your gaming group. It’s intended to
reflect the ways in which mortal (and, often, Awakened) society tends to
treat people who stand out from their cultural norms. Being who they are
and what they do, mages often do stand out in ways that can be hazardous
to their social and sometimes physical health – hello, Burning Times!
However, if this Flaw seems redundant in your group, creates unwanted
real-life tensions between your players, or gets abused by characters (or
players) who are catching hell for acting like dicks, then feel free to ignore
or discard this Flaw.
Dark Secret (1 pt. Flaw)
A skeleton or two is hanging rather precariously in your closet. If (let’s be
honest – when) it slips out and clatters to the floor, your life will get even more
difficult than it already is. Did you steal something precious that was in your
trust? Or live on the streets for a while? Maybe you came from a family you
would rather not discuss (see the Flaw: Family Issues, below), were involved
with a criminal organization, Awakened into a rival faction, or had a child or
lover you’re trying to forget about. In any case, you’ll be in trouble unless
you manage to keep that dark secret hidden… a feat that, in a world where
reading minds is damned near entry-level magick, can be difficult indeed.
(Note: Although this Flaw is traditionally worth only one point,
Dark Secrets with potentially deadly consequences might be worth
more points, at the Storyteller’s discretion.)
Debts (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Mages still need money in order to function in the human realm.
And in your case, you’re kinda fucked financially. Student loans,
credit-card debts, child-support payments, gambling losses, legal
judgments, medical bills, car and /or mortgage payments… the
ways in which a modern mage can get in over her head financially
are as numerous as the parties who prosper from such debts.
And then there’s the possibility of financial manipulation from
Awakened sources – mages or Night-Folk who, intentionally or
otherwise, are keeping you broke in order to assert their hold over
you (see Technocracy: Syndicate, p. 28). Maybe you just suck at the
whole paying-your-bills thing. For whatever reason, your income keeps
going back out. You might indeed have the Background: Resources,
but the money just doesn’t stay in your bank account for long.
As a Flaw, these Debts represent a minimum amount of
money you owe your creditors. The more you owe, the more
this Flaw is worth:
• (1 point) Minimal debt (less than $10,000).
• (2 points) Moderate debt (less than $50,000).
• (3 points) Significant debt (over $50,000).62 The Book of Secrets
• (4 points) Crushing debt (over $100,000).
• (5 points) Overwhelming debt (over $500,000).
From the three-point level onward, your creditors will
expend a fair amount (perhaps a great deal) of effort to collect
those funds from you. Certain creditors, like loan sharks,
will start far lower than that. Tactics could range from roundthe-clock phone calls and red-envelope letters to lawsuits,
repossessions, threats, eviction, and physical violence. For folks
with small and /or irregular incomes, the pressure from debt
and debt-collection harassment can cause intense emotional
and psychological distress… which, in turn, affects one’s ability
to make money… which deepens the debt… which deepens
the stress… in a desperate cycle that can lead to desperate acts.
Discredited (1 pt. Flaw)
In your chosen field, your name is mud. Perhaps you’re
a scientist whose bizarre theories have cost him the respect
of his peers… or an academic who wound up on the wrong
side of departmental politics… or a journalist who stepped
too far over the line of credibility. Whatever it is you did
(or are reputed to have done), your professional associates
look down on you. Add +2 to the difficulty of your social
and Background-based rolls when you’re trying to get those
associates to take you seriously. Although this is a common
Flaw among the feud-happy Etherites, anyone who depends
upon a professional reputation can be discredited in this
fashion – professorial Hermetics, corporate-ladder Syndicate
ops, White Tower agents, and other competitive-field mages
can fall afoul of a bad rep too.
Enemy (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, p. 647.
Esoteric Discourse /
Technobabbler (1 pt. Flaw)
Your obsessive love of a specialized field inspires you to fill
every waking hour with obscure jargon and obtuse metaphraseology. Most folks can’t understand half of what you say, and
their incomprehension of such elementary terminology impels
you to facilitate obligatory (if remedial) pedagogy. Oh, for fuck’s
sake – just talk normal for a change!
In game terms, this Flaw imposes difficulty modifiers (+1
or +2) on social rolls, thanks to the character’s compulsive jargonization, hyperinitiated nomenclature, and condescending
pedanticism. The Flaw’s first variation reflects arcane specialization, the second reflects tech-based terminology, and other
variations (Specious Legalese, Obtuse Academia, and so forth)
could reflect similar fascinations with other fields. For people
who actually understand you, however, the usual penalty might
become a social bonus instead… at which point everyone else
probably leaves the room and lets the experts talk amongst
themselves.
Family Issues (1 to 3 pt. Flaw)
Many mages leave their families behind. You didn’t do
that, although you may often wish you could. A flipside of the
Merit: Family Support (pp. 53-54), this Flaw saddles you with a
basket of goodies from Dysfunction Junction, family-style. You
might have a meddling uncle, an abusive sibling, an alcoholic
parent, or “simply” the leftovers from dealing with such people. You might have tried to escape them, but if so, someone
in your family is still looking for you. (See the Werewolf 20
Flaw: Persistent Parents, and the story “We Are the Shadows
Cast by the Memory of Giants” in Truth Beyond Paradox.)
The family doesn’t have to still be part of your physical reality,
but the mess they left behind if you managed to get away from
them remains a part of your existence today.
As with Supportive Family, the clan in question could be
blood relatives, an adopted family, or a family-of-choice you
kinda wish you hadn’t chosen. The more points you have in
this Flaw, the more your family issues interfere with your Awakened life. They could be mages themselves, though that’s not
often the case. More likely, they’re folks who still look for you
even in your Newlife, hangers-on who won’t leave you alone,
sickly relations who need tending (see also the Flaw: Ward,
p. 66), kids or siblings (or even parents) who have constant
troubles with the law… the possibilities are as endless as the
real-life complications that a troubled family can bring. And
no, you can’t just ditch out on ‘em even if you’ve already tried
to do so. If you could, they wouldn’t still be your problem,
now would they?
Infamy (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
You’ve made a bad name for yourself among the Masses.
Like the Background: Fame, this Flaw represents a degree of
recognition; in your case, though, that’s not a good thing…
especially not when you want to keep your life as a mage a
secret from the Sleepers.
Once again, the weight of the Flaw determines its value:
• (1 point) Certain people within a region or subculture
recognize and dislike you. (Examples: the local drunk,
Vox Day.)
• (2 points) Your notoriety was wide once, but has faded
to occasional recognition and disdain (H.R. Clinton,
M.C. Hammer).
• (3 points) You’re famous, but many people do not like
you (Kanye West, Nickelback).
• (4 points) The authorities don’t like you either (Roosh
V, Jared Fogle).
• (5 points) You’re a household name, and that name is
shit (O.J. Simpson, Charles Manson).
Especially in the age of social media and intelligence networks, this sort of infamy can be a very bad thing. Obviously,Chapter One: Heroic Traits 63
some folks adore you, if only because the rest of the world
hates you. On the whole, however, your reputation among the
Masses is more bad than good, and folks go out of their way
to give you a hard time. As with other bad reputations, you
may not have actually done anything wrong; then again, there
might be reasons that folks hate your guts.
Insane /Infamous Mentor (1 pt. Flaw)
The mage who taught you the ropes is dangerously tangled
up in them. Maybe she’s out of her head (though probably not
a Marauder… yet); or he’s got an awful rep that has splattered
all over you. That person could be angry at you for some reason
(good or otherwise), or live downstream on Shit Creek, with a
nasty habit of dragging you along for the ride. This Flaw makes
an excellent addition to the Background: Mentor, and has a
way of fouling up your relationships with other mages as well
as your bond with the mentor herself.
Mistaken Identity (1 pt. Flaw)
You’re not who folks think you are, but that doesn’t stop
them from thinking that you are that person. For some reason
– similar features, related habits, a bureaucratic fuck-up that
linked their data to you, or maybe some far more insidious
connection – confusion follows you around. This situation
is awkward at best, and can get downright dangerous if that
not-you person is wanted for serious crimes…
Naïve (1 pt. Flaw)
Surely, the world can’t be that dark… can it? (Spoiler:
Yes, yes it can.) Oblivious to the depths of misery around you,
you retain an intrinsic faith in the best possible outcome.
And while this sort of optimism can provide the foundation
for literally world-changing beliefs (see the paradigm It’s All
Good – Have Faith! in Mage 20, p. 570), it can also blind you
to the realities you face. When making a roll that could detect
another character’s bad intentions or malignant nature, add
+2 to the difficulty of your roll. Story-wise, you have a hard
time believing that the terrible things you see around you could
really be as bad as they seem, and may perhaps lack empathy
for other people’s pain (+2 to the difficulty of Empathy-based
rolls, at the Storyteller’s option) because you recognize so little
about pain yourself.
New Kid (1 pt. Flaw)
You’ve just recently Awakened, and you still have something to prove. Your peers don’t think much of you just yet,
and although you’ve got allies who consider you worth their
time, their investment in your goodwill is minimal. Add +2
to the difficulty of your social rolls with more experienced
mages until you’ve earned the right (and the experience) to buy
off this Flaw. On the good side, however, you’re likely to be
popular with certain companions, although – as “new meat”
in a social scene often discovers – that’s not always the kind
of attention you’ll want.
Offline (1 or 3 pt. Flaw)
You hate the goddamned Internet. As far as you’re concerned, it’s a complicated waste of time. You loathe social
networking, lack a webpage, refuse to Twitter, and don’t really
even know (or care) how to Google stuff. Anyone who wants to
contact you can damned well write a letter, use a telephone, or
just leave you the hell alone! (Damn kids, get off my digital lawn…)
While this Flaw is worth only one point in cultures where
the Internet is an occasional (and often privileged) indulgence,
it’s a three-point Flaw in cultures where Internet access and
participation are major elements of most people’s social lives.
Those cultural divides are more tied to generational and economic divides than they are to ethnic or geographical ones.
A poor, elderly, or simply old-fashioned New Yorker might
not really care about net access, so long as she can still stay in
contact with her friends and family; a college student in Rio,
however, would be at a pretty significant disadvantage if he
chose to avoid the Internet. And yeah – twenty-first-century
mages use the Internet too, even if they don’t visit the Digital
Web. Online presence isn’t just for Virtual Adepts anymore!
Rival House (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
You belong to a Chantry (or Construct, or whatever) that
has a longstanding animosity with another such organization.
This could be a rival Hermetic Chantry, a temple whose
members consider you to be heretics, a hostile street gang, an
opposing martial arts order, a coven that has declared a witchwar against your group, a Construct that has marked you all for
death, and so on. This antagonism is mutual, too, and you’re
expected to act accordingly. Mediation remains unlikely, and
things could get worse before they get better… if improved
relations are even possible.
Obviously, such hostility is personal, with deep roots in
the backstory of your chronicle and its characters. Groups of
mages don’t generally pursue mass grudges without serious
reasons to do so! The Flaw’s value depends upon the power
of that other stronghold and the level to which they hate
members of your own.
• (1 point) A minor rivalry with an associated Chantry of
equal or lesser power in relation to your own. For the
most part, the antagonism involves pranks, competition,
minor sabotage, and occasional “friendly” brawls.
• (2points) A significant rivalry (serious fights and slanders,
major sabotage) with a Chantry of similar power, or a
minor rivalry with a Chantry so powerful they don’t
consider yours to be a true threat.
• (3 points) Deadly antagonism between roughly equal
Chantries.
• (4 points) A significant rivalry between your Chantry
and one that’s powerful enough to inflict serious damage
upon your own.64 The Book of Secrets
• (5 points) Deadly hatred from a Chantry that could level
yours if they really wanted to… and they probably do.
From the three-point version onward, it’s pretty unlikely
that the rivalry can be resolved without a shared enemy or
some significant interference from an even more powerful
third party. It might not be resolvable even then. This Flaw
requires the Background: Chantry /Construct, but any
character with such associations can take it – the Flaw is not
restricted to mages from the Traditions and Technocracy.
Your rivalry might cross factions, too; a Hermetic House
might hold a longstanding enmity with a Progenitor lab.
It can also exist within a single group (two rival Etherite
collectives), or between two related groups that do not
belong to the same faction; alchemist sects, for example,
have been arguing over the name Solificati for centuries,
with no end in sight!
Sect Enmity (1 pt. Flaw)
Mage groups tend to have issues with each other by their
very nature. You, however, have managed to piss off an entire
sect of mages within your larger group. You could be a Verbena
witch who hacked off the Hermetic House Flambeau (yipe), a
Black Suit on the wrong side of the Friends of Courage, or a
Red Spear who trash-talked the Ghost Wheel Society and lived
to regret it. Although your enemies won’t try to kill you – you
are theoretically on the same side, after all – they really don’t
like your face, or much else about you.
Generally, the members of the sect in question will have
as little to do with you as they can, and won’t be terribly cooperative if they must deal with you at all. Social dice rolls you
make while dealing with members from this group add +2 to
the difficulty. You cannot, obviously belong to this sect when
you first take this Flaw, although you could conceivably smooth
things over, buy off the Flaw, and join that group later. A player
may buy this Flaw multiple times to reflect poor relationships
with several different sects. Storytellers are advised to create
several reoccurring characters from the rival sect, in order to
give this Flaw some teeth. For a more severe version of this
Flaw, see Hit List, below.
Special Responsibility (1 pt. Flaw)
You and your big mouth! Shortly after you joined your
current group, you stepped up and assumed a duty to that
group. Doing so earned you some points with the leadership,
but that duty comes at great cost to you. This responsibility
weighs on you to a significant degree, consuming time, energy,
and social, emotional and perhaps monetary resources you’d
rather devote to other things.
Obviously, you need to define what you’re doing for whom,
and what you need to do in the course of doing it. Although
it’s (probably) not dangerous in life-threatening ways, this Flaw
demands constant attention. Until you buy off the Flaw, you
really can’t skip out on your responsibilities.
Sympathizer (1 pt. Flaw)
Hey, they’re okay once you get to know them! You’ve expressed
some degree of sympathy for an enemy faction, and that sympathy
does not make you terribly popular! Maybe you’re a Technocrat
who sees validity in the Traditions, a Trad mage who shares
some part of the Technocratic vision, a Disparate mage with
secret ties to one of the other factions, or even – gods help
you! – a mage from pretty much any group, who dares to view
the Mad and Fallen as something other than walking targets
for instant execution. This Flaw goes well with other Flaws
like Rogue, Branded or Fifth Degree, and could well wind
up getting added to your character sheet if you’re not discreet
about your associations with rival mages.
Twisted Apprenticeship (1 pt. Flaw)
Someone taught you all the wrong things. For whatever
reason, the mentor who introduced you to the Awakened realm
did a terrible job, and now you reap the benefits. They may
have told you lies about other groups, filled your head with
nonsense about the nature of magick (though in all honesty,
pretty much everyone does that), or simply behaved like a raging
shmuck and left you with the payoff. Now folks blame you for
things you did not do (or you did out of ignorance), and the
mentor’s bad rep and worse teachings hang about you like a
god-slaying stink. You’ll probably recover eventually, but your
Awakened career got off to a wretched start.
Catspaw (2 pt. Flaw)
You trusted the wrong person, did the wrong thing on
their say-so, and have now become a liability to others and to
yourself. A dupe for someone vastly superior in power, you
need to watch your back now while hoping for an opportunity
to extract yourself from this position. For the moment, you
have to follow orders, and your “cat” needs to keep you safe.
Not long from now, however, one or both of you will change
your priorities, and then things will truly become interesting
for everyone concerned.
Diabolical Mentor (2 pt. Flaw)
Your mentor wasn’t merely bad at his job – he turned
out to be actively malevolent. That person could be an actual
Nephandus, a demented Marauder, a ruthless wizard, a diehard
“black hats and mirrorshades” type of Technocrat, an Infernalist
sellsoul… maybe you don’t even know what your mentor really
is, but it’s just plain bad. Obviously, this personage has fucked
you up. Additionally, if you’ve uncovered things he would rather keep secret, that could lead to other Flaws as well: Enemy,
Cursed, and worse…
Dogmatic (2 pt. Flaw)
Look, it’s great that you’ve got such strong spiritual convictions… but do you have to be such a dick about them? This
Flaw represents a religious, spiritual, and /or philosophical
approach that defines your moral and magickal beliefs. TroubleChapter One: Heroic Traits 65
is, your beliefs don’t play well with others; rules-wise, you add
+2 to the difficulty of all social rolls which involve dealing with
people of differing beliefs. Even when you’re trying, dammit,
to get along with those misguided heretics, folks can tell that
you don’t approve. You sneer, you argue, you try to convert
everyone around you to your way of thinking… you can’t help
it, really – your convictions are just that formidable! After
all, you do use them to change the world, so how could they
possibly be wrong?
Double Agent (2 pt. Flaw)
You work both sides of a very spiky fence; one of these
days, you’re gonna get stuck on it. Perhaps you’re a Syndicate
spy in the Ecstatic Cult, or an Etherite working with Iteration
X. In the days of the Disparate Alliance, you might belong to a
Tradition while ferreting data to your true Craft. Eventually, this
dangerous game will catch up with you. Make plans, establish
contingencies, and try not to get yourself perished!
Obviously, this Flaw must be kept secret from the other
characters in your group. For extra drama, try to keep it hidden
from the other players, too…
Failure (2 pt. Flaw)
Having blown a high-profile job, you’re now considered
a washout by your peers. Until and unless you manage you
redeem yourself, you’re essentially a laughingstock within your
group. Were you a Syndicate tycoon gone bust? A priest caught
doing the nasty with the choir? A cowardly Templar? A Pagan
gone Evangelical (or vice versa)? Life is made of reversals of
fortune, of course. Yeah, you’ll get back on top someday – it’s
just gonna be a hard climb.
Gullible (2 pt. Flaw)
You believe everything folks tell you. You repost memes
without checking their accuracy or source. You fall for cons and
pranksters every single time. Seriously? How can a mage be so
goddamned gullible? Beats me, but yeah – subtract three dice
from every dice pool you roll (down to a minimum of one die)
when you’re trying to penetrate falsehoods (lies, not stealth), or
to fool people with your own bumbling attempts at deception.
Old Flame (2 pt. Flaw)
A former love of your life now works for the enemy. Worse,
she knows your weak spots, and can still call on you “for old
times’ sake.” Unless you manage to succeed in a resisted Manipulation-based social roll contest (see Mage 20, pp. 390-391)
when your old flame tries (again) to win you over (again), you’ll
find yourself doing things (again) against your better judgment
again… and again… and again…
Troublemaker (2 pt. Flaw)
Pretty much the inverse of the Merit: Sanctity (p. 57); you
project an impression of guilt even when you haven’t done
anything wrong. Folks blame you for pretty much everything,
and the authorities go harder on you than they might if you
didn’t seem like such a noxious little turd! You come across
like a natural-born sinner regardless of how you behave. Gee, if
you’re gonna get punished no matter what you do, maybe you
ought to at least have some fun before the whip comes down.
Expendable (3 pt. Flaw)
An upper-level member of your group wants you dead,
and sticks you with missions that will probably get the job
done sooner rather than later. You could be the lab assistant
who keeps being told to send those big metal kites up into the
thunderstorm, the apprentice who keeps getting sent off to
obtain forbidden artifacts, or the Black Suit who keeps facing
off against yet another goddamned werewolf pack while his
dispatcher makes excuses for the lack of timely backup. Either
way, you’re pretty screwed. Worst of all, no one will openly
admit that’s the case, and you may not even know who’s got it
out for you, much less why they’re trying to get you perished.
Although this Flaw works best for Technocratic operatives
(who remain subject to orders no matter who they might be),
it suits any Awakened group that operates with a top-down
hierarchy wherein high-ranking mages assign missions to lower-ranking ones and expect those orders to be obeyed – say, the
Templar Knights, the Order of Hermes, the Celestial Chorus,
and so forth. It does not suit shamans, Ecstatics, or other mages
who don’t give a flying fuck what their so-called superiors say.
(Note: This Flaw resembles the Flaw of the same name in
Vampire: The Masquerade. Mages, however, die much more
easily than vampires do when one of their superiors wants to
get them killed, and so the Flaw is worth considerably more
in Mage than it is in Vampire.)
Narc (3 pt. Flaw)
Cursed with the rep of an informer, you’re on the outs
with your would-be associates. As with other reputation-based
Flaws, this shunning may be based on mistakes and rumors;
in this case, though, it’s probably at least somewhat accurate.
Known spies and spymasters, intelligence officers, witnesses
against their fellow mages, members of groups that are assigned
to investigation and justice (like House Quaesitor or the Ivory
Tower), and other real or assumed snitches generally catch
such reputations by default. System-wise, this Flaw adds +1 to
the difficulty of social rolls when dealing with people who fear
you might be spying on them; story-wise, such people could be
feeding you misinformation, stonewalling you, or plotting to
take you out when the moment to do so seems right.
Notoriety (3 pt. Flaw)
Thanks to this inverse of the Merit:Prestige, you’re saddled
with a bad reputation among your fellow mages. System-wise,
this Flaw adds +2 to the difficulties of all social rolls within
your faction (Traditions, Crafts, Technocracy, etc.), and predisposes pretty much everyone outside your closest friends to
think the worst of you. Rumors dog your steps, and whispers66 The Book of Secrets
precede your appearance. Whether or not the stories are true,
you’ve been linked to some disgrace, and will be shunned and
probably punished accordingly if you haven’t been punished
already. (See the Supernatural Flaw: Branded, p. 89, for a
potential punishment, or for an alternative to this Flaw that
could be taken by a Tradition mage character.) You might be
able to shuck this bad rep eventually, but it’s gonna be a pretty
rough road until you do.
Rivalry (3 to 5 pt. Flaw)
An associate of yours has it out for you, and while this
rival cannot openly move against you (probably because of
an external authority she doesn’t want to risk annoying, or
social pressures that she can’t avoid), she’ll make your life as
difficult as she can under the circumstances. Rumors, sabotage,
exposed scandals, and perennial traps are just a few of your
rival’s weapons against you. And while you can dance around
most of them, a few still manage to hit their mark.
The value of this Flaw depends, as usual, on the amount
of trouble this rivalry causes for you:
• (3 points) Someone of a lower or equal degree of power
and influence wants to complicate your life.
• (4 points) A rival of greater power and influence throws
obstacles in your path whenever possible.
• (5 points) A far more powerful rival is seriously dedicated
to keeping you miserable… possibly even to making you
dead.
Why does this person hate you? It could be a “simply
business” sort of situation, like the rivalry between Syndicate
executives or Hermetic Adepts. There may be a romantic tangle
or family history involved, or perhaps an academic dispute,
as is often found among members of the Etherite Tradition
or Progenitor lab-groups. Chances are, this person doesn’t
actually want you dead – just disgraced or removed from
further consideration. Fatal rivalries do arise, however… and
as Doissetep’s implosion proved long ago, such things can get
really ugly when mages are involved.
Rotten Liar (3 pt. Flaw)
Man, you suck at lying! You could not tell a credible untruth if your life depended on it… which it might, so this can be
sort of a problem for you. It may be that you’re just too honest
for your own good, or cursed to speak the truth as you know
it, regardless of the cost or your intentions; then again, you
might just stammer your way through attempted deceptions,
telegraphing your lies through body language and vocal tone.
Whatever the reason, add +2 to the difficulty of any die roll
you make when you’re trying to deceive another character. Yes,
this penalty extends to magickal deceptions too, like illusions
or mind control. Honesty might not always be the best policy
among the Awakened, but for you it’s generally the best option.
Sleeping with the Enemy (3 pt. Flaw)
A paramour of yours belongs to an enemy group – Awakened
antagonists, perhaps, or maybe one of the Night-Folk (as per the
old Flaw: Massasa Contact). This isn’t simply a matter of rivalry;
if you’re discovered, you’re both probably gonna die. Still, love (or
lust) is a powerful force, and so you and your loved one live out one
of those Romeo and Juliet situations. Just remember, though: Romeo
and Juliet is a tragedy, not a romance, and things are likely to go the
same way for you. (Again, see the entries for both those genres in
Chapter Five’s section regarding Genre, Storytelling, and Mage.)
Ward (3 pt. Flaw)
Mages rarely move through life alone. And when certain
companions – lovers, children, partners, parents, close friends,
even employers – depend upon you, that lack of loneliness can
become a liability. This Flaw represents a character, or a group of
characters, who require constant attention on your part. Your life is
a hazard to them, and their needs often provide hazards for you as
well. Wards tend to get in trouble, require rescuing, and go digging
into aspects of your life you’d prefer they left alone. Is it love that
binds you to your ward? Duty? An oath? Family obligations? A job
like bodyguarding, teaching or medicine? Regardless of the reason,
each ward is an essential part of your life. Their life is your priority.
Although Ward characters may have a useful skill or two,
such folks are unAwakened people, not mages, Night-Folk,
familiars, or other powerful entities. That said, you could take
a Ward Flaw to reflect a special bond with a Retainer, a Cult
member, or one of your Spies. Merits like Supportive Family
or True Love (and Flaws like Family Issues) go well with the
Ward Trait. Wards don’t have to be human, either – your dog,
your cat, your horse… an animal who depends upon you could
be a ward as well. You can take this Flaw more than once, to
reflect several dependent characters. Yeah, there are reasons
that mages tend to avoid having big families!
Obviously, each ward is a Storyteller character, with all the
agendas and complications that situation entails. This person
might not count as aSleeper witnesswith regards to your magick…
but if you’ve been keeping that person in the dark with regards
to your true life and nature, they could still count as a witness
for at least their first experience with your sort of “reality.”
Echo Chamber (4 pt. Flaw)
You surround yourself with groupthink. All opinions
on important topics (politics, religion, magick, and so forth)
must remain unified. No disagreements on such matters are
permitted within this echo chamber, and anyone who bucks
that decree is shown the door – often with great force – and
shunned, probably vilified, afterward. Loyalty to the group is
measured by the devotion each member shares with regards
to the “truth” as your group understands it. As a result, that
“truth” soon gets distorted. Like an echo reverberating within
a closed space, it verges into a distortion of the original source,
growing wilder and more extreme until something has to give.
Will that breaking point be you? Gods forbid…Chapter One: Heroic Traits 67
Essentially a story-based Trait, this Flaw cuts your character off from information that runs contrary to the group’s
determined “truth.” Characters and data that disagree with
that “truth” must be pushed aside, ignored, silenced, possibly
attacked, maybe even destroyed “for the good of the group.”
Because isolation breeds distortion, the Storyteller should
gradually make “the truth” seem more extreme than it once had
been. Anyone – especially a player character – who disagrees
with “the truth” should be punished by the group; the more
extreme the distortions become, the harsher the punishment
becomes as well. Eventually, the distorted “truth” will require
distorted acts as well: assault, torture, murder, terrorism. At
that point, any character who tries to step away will become the
enemy too (possibly receiving the Flaw of that name) – shunned
by former friends at the very least, probably disgraced socially,
and potentially even attacked physically for being a traitor to
the cause.
This Flaw reflects a social phenomenon that’s increasingly
common in the twenty-first century, though it’s certainly not
exclusive to our era: a social group committed to enforced
orthodoxy and the removal of dissent. The group in question
could be a religious or military order, a socio-political activist
tribe, a corporate office, a think-tank, an art collective, a fannish subculture, a media outlet, mystic sect, or Political Action
Committee – any social clique that holds “certain truths to be
self-evident” and vital to that group’s existence could become
an echo chamber. “Us” and “them” is a ruling principle, and
if you’re not one of Us, then you’re one of Them.
Hit List (4 pt. Flaw)
A rival group wants you dead. You might be a Templar
who’s made enemies among the Etherites, an Etherite who
crossed the line with the New World Order, and so forth.
Whatever happened, it’s personal and extends to the entire
group. As with the Vampire 20 Flaw: Clan Enmity, this is a
deadly business, far worse than the one-point Sect Enmity,
above. Social rolls when dealing with members of this group
add +2 to their difficulty – if you get a chance to make such
rolls at all. Whether or not the enemy group actively attacks
you on sight, its members will go out of their way to make your
life solitary, unpleasant, nasty, brutish, and short.
Mr. Red Tape (4 pt. Flaw)
Bureaucracy hates you. Any official complication that could
go wrong will go wrong if you’re the one who’s dealing with the
authorities. Essentially the opposite of the Merit: Master of Red
Tape (p. 58), this Flaw adds + 2 to the difficulty of any roll you
make when trying to get something done through an established
system, and throws stupid mistakes and delays into the works
whenever you’ve got to work with any sort of bureaucracy.68 The Book of Secrets
Overextended (4 pt. Flaw)
You’ve tried to do too much, and the strain has begun to
show. Even when you add Time Sphere magick to the equation,
there really are only so many hours in a day, and you spend most
of them just trying to keep up with various commitments. You’re
on too many committees, stuck with too many reports, nurturing
too many connections, maintaining too many resources for one
person – even a mage – to handle. Other characters, on top of
it all, have begun to undermine your ability to juggle all those
plates, and folks are gunning for your position if and when you
finally fuck up badly. While this Flaw best suits members of the
Technocratic Union, it’s appropriate for any mage who belongs
to a group that prizes involvement, most especially the Hermetic
Order, Celestial Chorus, Wu Lung, and Templar Knights.
Probationary Member (4 pt. Flaw)
Having recently defected from a rival group or faction,
you’re on probation with the current group. Peers expect you
to turn on them, and certain folks have probably decided to
throw you under the bus on general principle. Your continued
membership (possibly even your survival) depends upon doing
everything right and nothing wrong… and just how often do
things really go that well in the real world, anyway?
Rogue (4 pt. Flaw)
The loosest of cannons, you’re gonna do whatever you
damn well please, and to hell with any and all consequences!
You might still belong to a group, but your membership is more
a matter of habit or convenience than of loyalty. Alternately,
you may have gone your way and now exist in a nebulous state
between fondly remembered comrade and total outlaw. Certain
Backgrounds (Requisitions and Secret Weapon) are forbidden
to you now, and others (Allies, Backup, Chantry, Resources,
and potentially many more) are hard to access – perhaps even
impossible to access – if their connection to you depends upon
your allegiance to a group. Former peers consider you a liability,
and the main reason no one has taken you out yet is because
nobody’s gotten around to doing so successfully.
For Technocratic operatives, this Flaw is a slow-motion
death sentence; for other mages, it could involve similar threats
to longevity, although many Crafts (aside from the Templars,
Wu Lung, and Hippolytoi) and most Traditions (aside from
the Chakravanti, Akashayana, and Order of Hermes) take a
more liberal approach to rogue members. Either way, your
relationships with former allies are strained at best (+3 to the
difficulty of most social rolls involving their goodwill), and
you’re on rather hostile terms with your so-called (or former)
superiors. Some mages manage to live for quite a while in this
state of mutual antagonism. Most, however, do not.
Witch-Hunted (4 pt. Flaw)
The Masses want you dead. You’ve been exposed for what
you are and can do, and so various unAwakened parties have
decided to take you out like the abomination you’ve become.
These hunters could be law-enforcement authorities, religious
groups, fanatical sects, furious mobs, imbued hunters, pawns
of the Night-Folk… whoever they might be, these people offer a
significant threat to your existence, possessing the power to end
you and the dedication to back it up. Your Arts alone cannot
stop them, and a painful showdown (or three) is sadly inevitable.
Fifth Degree (5 pt. Flaw)
Whether you know it or not, you have outlived your usefulness to the Technocratic Union. Your superiors have set you
up to fall, and your date with Room 101 or a suicide mission
waits right around the corner. Combine all the deficits of the
Flaw: Rogue (above) with the assurance that you’re only alive
because someone would rather have you take out the bad guys
when you go down in a blaze of glory than spend the resources
necessary to take you down themselves. You have one more
chance to make good and stay alive. Step out of line again, and
your fate will be the sort of thing that makes cyborgs cringe.
Supernatural Merits
Nothing’s really “supernatural” to a mage. Still, some
Merits and Flaws defy the easy categories that Sleepers impose
upon their world. A more appropriate name, perhaps, would
be Metaphysical Merits: benefits of the unseen world that work
in ways the mundane world rarely understands.
Given the powerful nature of such Merits and Flaws, the
Storyteller may disallow certain Traits from the following section.
Several previously published Supernatural Merits and Flaws have
been revised from their original appearance, or else omitted
entirely, because their initial extravagance runs at odds with the
Mage 20 rules and atmosphere. Players could, with Storyteller
approval, still employ those Traits, but we advise against it. A
handful of those Traits, however – notably Claws /Fangs /Horns
/Hooves /Barbed Tail, Immunity, and Resistant Pattern – can
be found in the Mage 20 sourcebook Gods, Monsters & Familiar Strangers, as they represent abilities that are more suited to
non-human entities than to all-too-human mages.
Burning Aura (1 pt. Merit)
To those who can sense it, your aura burns with amazing
brilliance and clarity. Even folks who can’t actually perceive
this bright corona of energy realize that you’re “different.”
Entities that can read your aura react accordingly; some will
treat you with uncommon respect, while others will view you
as a nice meal. The nature of your aura cannot be hidden
easily (+2 to the difficulty of any attempt to do so), and while
this is a dreadful disadvantage for, say, a Nephandus, people
who prize forthright integrity may reduce their difficulties by
-2 when they’re trying to make an impression that’s in accord
with that vivid aura and affecting characters who can sense it.
Assuming that you employ these optional Traits, your
Resonance and Synergy each get a vivid, one-dot boost from
this Merit – see Chapter Three, pp. 133-134, for details. For
aura colors and tones, see Mage 20, p. 507.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 69
Green Thumb (1 pt. Merit)
Plants flourish from your touch. Although they don’t
bloom and grow on contact (a wildly paranormal effect which
was part of this Merit’s original form), they do attain a healthy
boost when you work with them. Reduce the difficulty of all
non-Arete rolls by -2, and reduce the difficulty of Arete rolls by
-1, when you work with plants, trees, and other forms of vegetation –algae, mold, fungus, seaweed, and the like. Story-wise,
your aura pulsates with green vitality, plant matter grows fast
and robust in your presence, and your Resonance and Synergy
reflect a powerful connection to the green world. A common
Merit among Verbena, Bata’a, and other primal mystics, this
could also represent a strange acumen for vegetative biomass
that certain technomancers enjoy.
Bardic Gift (2 pt. Merit)
Blessed with uncanny inspiration, you create profoundly
evocative artwork. Truth echoes through your words, blazes
from your canvas, resonates in song, speaks silently in dance.
Although artistic skill is, of course, important, this gift runs
deeper than mere technique. Art is your passion, your spirit,
your Truth. And that Truth manifests itself in whatever arts
you pursue, up to and including the Magickal Arts.
When making a roll with the Art Talent, reduce the difficulty
by -2. Even when the attempt itself falls short of your expectations
(that is, when you fail a roll), your creations feature an unmistakable gleam of brilliance and a preternatural expression of Truth.
Although you’re not required (as a player) to employ artwork as
part of your magickal focus, chances are good that your approach
to magick does feature elements of painting, dance, music, and
other manifestations of artistic expression.
Circumspect Avatar (2 pt. Merit)
You’ve never seen your Avatar, and probably doubt that
such a thing exists. Sure, you have a shadow, and a reflection,
or maybe a little dog who’s followed you around since you were
a kid and seems no older even though he should have died of
old age years ago, but an Avatar? Nah – that’s a buncha New
Age hippie crap! You have yet to encounter any such thing, you
don’t go on “seekings” or whatever they’re called, and you get
your metaphysical insights the same way any normal person
does: through everyday events in the everyday world.
Essentially, this Merit grants a “silent” Avatar – one that,
for whatever reason, does not hound or guide your character
but merely drops hints, cues, and clues that the mage either
figures out or doesn’t figure out on her own. Seekings and
Epiphanies take place in the physical realm, typically as puzzles
and dilemmas that happen to be related to issues that the mage
needs to sort through in order to advance to the next level of
understanding. During such situations, the Avatar may indeed
appear (possibly even manifest – see the Merit:Manifest Avatar,
p. 71), but only as some apparently mundane person, creature
or thing, not as an obviously paranormal entity. You could,
for instance, get a call from your mother that sends you into
an introspective mood which, in turn, leads you to figure out
an important riddle from your past; Mom, of course, denies
even having called you. Huh. So who could that call have been
from, anyway? Or did you, perhaps, just imagine it after all?
Faerie Affinity (2 pt. Merit)
Fae beings like you. Drawn by an ineffable appeal, they
seek you out and share secrets with you that few mortals even
comprehend. System-wise, you lower the difficulty of your social
rolls by -2 when you’re dealing with changelings and related
entities; in return, changelings reduce their difficulty by -2
when they attempt – through whatever method – to obtain
Glamour from you, or to enchant you so as to bring you into
their ephemeral realm. Story-wise, the Fae tend to favor you
over other mortals, even when your temperaments would seem
to be at odds with one another. A gruff Nocker, for example,
normally has no use for frivolity… but in your case, you silly
Cultist, he’ll make this one exception!
Technomancers, being considered “banal” in the eyes of
the Fae, may not purchase this Merit. Even if they don’t belong to the Technocratic Union, the presence of such mages is
metaphysical poison to the Dreaming Ones. (See Changeling:
The Dreaming for details about the effects of Glamour and
Banality on changelings.)
Medium (2 pt. Merit)
You possess an unnerving affinity for the Restless Dead…
or perhaps it’s that they possess an unnerving affinity for you.
Although you cannot actually see ghosts unless you have at least
one dot in the Spirit Sphere, those ghosts can talk to you, and
you can talk to them. A successful Perception + Awareness roll
allows you to sense their presence even if you can’t see or hear
them nearby, and your aura shines faintly like a spirit-beacon
in the Shadowlands. As a result, the dead tend to favor you
(unless they’re trying to kill you), and can become quite chatty
if they have something to say. Given how deeply mages prize
information, such chattiness can be rather helpful and occasionally life-changing.
Because “chatty” can quickly become “obnoxious,” this
Merit is a double-sided blade. You reduce the difficulty of your
social rolls by -2 when dealing with ghosts, and may perceive
things that the living normally cannot understand. The things
you perceive, though, aren’t always pleasant, and – seeing as
how ghosts tend to stick around because they have unfinished
business to attend to – the dead can get downright annoying
with their requests.
For details about the Restless Dead, see Wraith: The
Oblivion. For system details about Sphere-based necromancy,
see the section of that name in the M20 sourcebook How Do
You DO That?, pp. 84-89.
Unaging (2 pt. Merit)
The years seem to pass you by. Time moves on, but you
remain essentially the same physical age as you were when this70 The Book of Secrets
Merit stopped your aging process. Maybe you discovered the
Fountain of Youth, upgraded yourself to perpetual stability,
assumed an odd relationship with the time stream, or entered
an uncanny bargain that preserved your current age. And so,
although you continue to accumulate the scars, experience,
and perspective of age, your body maintains a consistent state
of chronological development. Note that this is not the same
thing as immortality – injuries and sickness can kill you just as
surely as they’ll kill any other person. Age-based decrepitude,
however, is not something you’ll have to worry about.
Celestial Affinity (3 pt. Merit)
You get along especially well with a certain type of spirit
entity. Depending upon your practice, you might relate well
with nature spirits, High Umbral Courtiers, Digital Web entities, the Restless Dead, the Loa, angelic or demonic beings,
and so forth.
When you’re dealing with entities within a single selected
category, you reduce the difficulty of your summoning and
negotiation rolls by -2. (See the section that deals with Summoning, Binding, Bargaining, and Warding in How Do You
DO That?, pp. 90-95.) This bonus does not apply to attempts to
bind or ward against such beings, as it’s based upon goodwill, not
force. It does, however, apply to the Arete rolls when casting
the summoning Effect (within the normal modifier limits, as
usual), because the entities in question are more inclined to
show up when you call upon them.
For three additional points per category, you may add another
category of spirits, assuming that your practice favors an affinity for
such spirits. (A BCD Void Engineer “ghost-buster,” for example,
could not purchase an Affinity for ghosts, though a necromancer
could certainly do so.) If you abuse this goodwill, as one might
imagine, this bonus, and the Merit, both go away – and might
wind up being replaced by a Flaw like Immortal Enemy (p. 93)
if your mage behaves in an especially foolish manner.
Cloak of the Seasons (3 pt. Merit)
Adverse weather does not bother you. Regardless of your
clothing or lack thereof, you’re essentially immune to the effects
of exposure to harsh climates, as described in Mage 20, p. 435.
You still need to eat, drink, and breathe – this Merit won’t save
you from starvation or suffocation – and climate-based obstacles (fog, high winds, snowdrifts, ice, etc.) hinder you as badly
as they’ll hinder anybody else. Aside from outright attacks by
the elements, however, you remain untouched by extremes of
temperature and climate. You might not always be comfortable,
but you’ll survive.
Cyclic Magick (3 pt. Merit /Flaw)
The strength or weakness of your Arts is tied to some periodic
cycle – the phases of the moon, night or day, your menstrual
periods, the rise and fall of the stock market, and so forth. At
the peak of your cycle, your magick flows most easily; at its nadir,
you find it challenging to work with your magick at all.
System-wise, this Trait is both a Merit and a Flaw, granting
bonuses at one point in the cycle and penalties on its opposite
point. At the highest point, you reduce your casting difficulties
by -3 for one hour, while at the lowest point you increase them
by +3 for one hour. On either end of that cycle, you subtract
or add -1 /+1 to your casting difficulties for each hour on both
sides – the surge and the ebb – of that cycle: -2 or + 2 for the two
hours on each side of the peak or nadir, -1 or +1 on the two hours
on the side of those two hours, and no modifiers during the rest
of the time in between. If, for example, Victoria Ashley-Croft
bani Flambeau has a peak at midnight and a low at noon, her
player would receive a peak modifier of -3 difficulty at midnight,
-2 difficulty at 11:00 PM and 1:00 AM, a -1 difficulty at 10:00
PM and 2:00 AM, and no modifiers otherwise, aside from the
reverse modifiers (+3 at noon, +2 at 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM, and
+1 at 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM) at the opposite end of that cycle.
Naturally, you’ll need to decide just what this cycle is when
you select this Trait, and then determine what the highest and
lowest points of that cycle would be. This Merit must also be
tied into your focus – intrinsically connected to the beliefs you
hold and the practices you follow. Your choice of instruments is
often tied to such cycles too; cycle-bound instruments include
celestial alignments, crossroads and crossing-days, formulae
and mathematics, group rites, money and wealth, music (peaks
and lulls in a song, movements in a symphony, etc.), numbers
and numerology, and offerings and sacrifices (“when the stars are
right”). A stockbroker will be watching the peaks and ebbs on Wall
Street, while a witch pays attention to the cycles of the moon or
her blood. By observing your cycles, you’ll have a good idea about
the best and worst times to use your Arts. And by observing you,
your allies and enemies may be able to figure those things out too.
Danger Sense (3 pt. Merit)
A heightened state of awareness allows you to sense impending harm. This gift could originate from primal perceptiveness,
intense conditioning, spirit voices that warn you of danger,
nanotech sensors, or other methods of refined cognizance.
Whatever the source of this Merit might be, your Storyteller
must make a secret Perception + Alertness roll for you when
some otherwise hidden threat is heading toward your character.
The difficulty for this roll depends upon the immediacy
of the danger; a distant, abstract sort of danger (like a plot to
kill you) is far harder to sense than an onrushing disaster (like
a sniper’s bullet), and would thus have a higher difficulty (say,
difficulty 10 for the plot, difficulty 6 for the bullet). A simple
success would tell you that something’s wrong, while a large
number of successes could pinpoint the nature and location
of the threat.
Your Storyteller, of course, is under no obligation to give
you objective details about that threat. She could be as vague
as “A chill tightens across your scalp,” with perhaps a hint of the
direction and nature of the danger’s source (“A sudden metallic
clicking sound echoes in from behind your right side. What do you do?”).Chapter One: Heroic Traits 71
Hands of Daedalus (3 pt. Merit)
You’ve got an innate gift for crafting machines and technology. Such devices seem to come to life in your hands, fitting
easily into place and functioning with incredible precision once
you’ve worked with ‘em. Although this gift does not extend
to the ins and outs of software technology, you can work on
computer hardware (assuming that you know what you’re doing)
as naturally as you can tune a ’58 Ford.
From a systems standpoint, any rolls you make to craft, repair,
invent, or otherwise modify mechanical technologies are at -2
difficulty when you’ve got the opportunity to put those Hands
of Daedalus to work. Tech-based magickal instruments (see the
Mage 20 entries for Armor, Devices and Machines, and other
hardware-based technologies) and practices (see Craftwork and
Hypertech in the Focus and the Arts section of Mage 20, Chapter Ten) function, in your hands, as Personalized Instruments
(Mage 20, pp. 503 and 587-588) once you’ve had a chance to
get familiar with them… and to have them get familiar with you.
Lucky (3 pt. Merit)
Lady Fortune has a thing for you. As a result, you may
re-roll a failed die roll (botches included) up to three times per
story (not per session). Each do-over may be rerolled only once,
so don’t push your luck too far.
Manifest Avatar (3 pt. Merit)
For most mages, the Avatar remains a mysterious figure,
goading them from the sidelines and appearing primarily
within a Seeking or during other moments of intense stress.
For you, however, the Avatar is a vibrant presence in your
life, as real to you as anyone else. Essentially a character in
its own right, this manifested Avatar interacts with you on
an almost daily basis. In certain situations, it might interact
with other people, as manifestly real as any other person in
your world.
The Manifest Avatar Merit embodies the Avatar as a full
character under the Storyteller’s control. On its own, this
Merit reflects that Avatar as a person who only the associated
mage can see, hear, and interact with on a physical level; in
conjunction with the Background: Allies, however, the Avatar
becomes a character that everyone can see, hear, and feel. In
both cases, the Avatar may come and go as it pleases, bound
only by the physical laws with which it chooses to be bound.
The physical Avatar’s shell can be injured or killed, but that
in itself does not kill the Avatar – merely its body. For obvious
reasons, that solid Avatar should have a guise that won’t be
too vulgar or bizarre for the Consensus to endure – a cloaked,
whispering figure, perhaps, but not a screeching, tentacled
monstrosity. The manifested Avatar’s Traits depend upon the
value of the Allies Background, as well as the physical form of
that incarnation. An equine or lupine Avatar, for instance, will
have different Traits than an Avatar that manifests as a crow,
shadow, mirror, or child.
Your Avatar does not hang a sign around her neck that
proclaims Avatar. In the first edition Cult of Ecstasy Tradition
Book, for example, Cassie deals with a manifested Avatar named
Aria who never reveals herself to be anything other than a wild
child who looks disturbingly like an alternate-reality version of
Cassie and knows things no one else should know about Cassie’s
past, present, future, and inner self. (For details, see that book,
pp. 5-45.) Unless either the mage or the Avatar announces its
true identity, other characters don’t usually think that your
manifested Avatar is anything other than what it appears to be.
Mages or Night-Folk who can see auras or souls might catch
on, but most other folks remain clueless.
An Avatar manifesting only for the mage can affect the
material world only when no other characters or devices can
see that entity, although it might appear to others as an online
presence, a ghostly figure, as odd sounds, or through other phenomena. An Allies-based Avatar remains as solid as it wants to
be, lacking the powers of a human mage but possessed (literally)
of the power to fade in and blink out as it desires. Again, the
Manifested Avatar is a Storyteller character, with agendas and
behavioral quirks that confound both the mage and his player.
Although that Avatar has its mage’s best interests at heart, it
might play the role of a rival, lover, best friend, or nemesis…
quite possibly all of them at once.
Mark of Favor (3 pt. Merit)
A godlike entity has claimed you as its own, and has
stamped your features with evidence of that claim. You might
have the bushy red hair and sly eyes of Reynard the Fox, the
hearty temper and brawny build of Thor, the compassionate
fury of the Christ in your eyes, or Legba’s lame leg and penchant
for corncob pipes and tobacco. Folks who understand the lore
of your associated god-form recognize this Mark of Favor, and
even those who don’t know who you’re marked by realize that
there’s something special about you.
An excellent companion to the Background: Legend,
and already an element of the Background: Totem (see Totem
Mark in Mage 20, p. 327), this Trait provides a recognizable
connection to a renowned god-form. Whether or not this
actually is a sign of divine favor, of course, depends upon your
Storyteller’s preferred theological metaphysics. As far as your
character is concerned, it totally is. Note that such favor isn’t
always a happy thing; mythology is full of people who shared
dysfunctional relationships with divine parents and patrons!
When dealing with people who recognize the Mark and
respect the deity that bestowed it, you subtract -2 from the difficulty of related social rolls. Opponents of your divine patron
consider you an enemy, and although intimidation-style rolls still
receive the -2 reduction in difficulty, rolls that attempt to get on
the good side of such people add +2 to the difficulty instead.
A Mark of Favor may, at the Storyteller’s discretion, bestow
other miraculous talents, too. Strange things happen, and those
things remain beyond the Marked character’s control. Someone
chosen by the Virgin Mary could possess a minor healing touch,72 The Book of Secrets
while the chosen of Thor has a literally shocking touch
when he gets mad. Again, these powers exist completely at the
Storyteller’s whim, and suit the flavor of the story, not the
desires of the player. Essentially, they’re miracles granted by
your god, both given and taken in mysterious ways.
Natural Channel (3 pt. Merit)
You’ve got an innate affinity with the Otherworlds.
Sliding through from the mortal realm to the Three Worlds is
easier for you than it is for other Awakened folk. System-wise,
you subtract -2 from the difficulty of your rolls to penetrate
the Gauntlet. Story-wise, crossing over feels, to you, like a
primal sort of homecoming, as if you exist between worlds
on an elemental level.
Natural Shapeshifter (3 pt. Merit)
Guided by an innate affinity for metamorphosis, you
can change your shape more easily than most mages do.
Such changes still demand the usual Life Sphere Ranks and
Effects, but your difficulty for such rolls is reduced by -2
(the usual limits apply), and you don’t need to worry about
losing yourself in the new form, as described in How Do
You DO That?, p. 20. Such talents don’t necessarily link
you to the Night-Folk, although this Merit fits in well with
Fae Blood or Shapechanger Kin (and the Mental Flaw:
Feral Mind, as well; see p. 52). The gift does not, however,
affect your ability to change other people’s shapes in any
way. Such talent works for you alone.
For a potentially related paradigm and practice, see
the Chapter Three entries We are Meant to be Wild
(p. 93) and Animalism ( pp. 197-199).
Oracular Ability (3 pt. Merit)
Everything, to you, has a richer significance than it might
otherwise appear. The flight of birds, the fall of cards, the
patterns of sand after a wave, a spatter of sacrificial blood…
in your eyes, they’re all clues to the Universal Mystery.
You’re good at deciphering such clues, and so while many
enigmas remain unanswered, you often spot insights that
other people – even mages – fail to see.
In game terms, you can make a Perception + Awareness
roll (difficulty 7) whenever the Storyteller feels you’re in
a position to perceive a hidden message in apparently
random phenomena. If you do spot what appears to be
a message, you can make a second roll of Perception +
Esoterica (or Occult, whichever is higher) to see if you
can interpret the message you think you see. The difficulty of this interpretation roll depends on how random
the phenomena is; a deck of cards, for instance, is less
random (difficulty 6 or 7) than a scatter of crow feathers
(difficulty 8 or 9), and so is better suited for divination
purposes. This doesn’t mean you can’t read that scatter
of feathers, only that doing so is more challenging than
interpreting a deck of cards!Chapter One: Heroic Traits 73
A successful interpretation roll wins a vague yet potentially
valuable answer from the Storyteller – couched, of course, in
symbolic metaphors and wide-open meanings. (Storytellers, see
The Deeper Level in Mage 20, pp. 363-366, and Prophecy
and Hindsight in How Do You DO That?, pp. 55-56, for
guidance.) Such answers are not at all reliable, naturally, but
they stand a decent chance of being accurate enough to help
you read patterns in apparently random chance.
Parlor Trick (3 pt. Merit)
You’ve honed a special trick – a simple, specific, non-combat application of your Arts – which you can perform without
making a casting roll. Such tricks include things like conjuring
a business card, stirring a pot without touching the spoon (or
the pot), igniting your cigarette without lighters or a match,
producing a small amount of light without mechanical contrivance, changing your hair color with a shake of your head, and
so on. To a Sleeper, these tricks look like something a normal
person could do with a mysterious bit of skill. You, of course,
realize that the skill in question is not quite what they think it is.
Three important rules govern this Merit:
• It cannot be a feat with direct damage-producing combat
applications (though a “light your cigarette” trick could
also work with a stream of flowing gasoline). No popping
claws or conjuring firearms!
• It must be a quick, simple action that a Sleeper witness
could explain away as practiced sleight of hand.
• These tricks are limited to things you could do with
Sphere Ranks 1 to 3, apply to only one specific trick (conjuring a rose, say, not conjuring anything that’s roughly
rose-sized), and you must have the Spheres necessary to
perform the feat in the first place. This Merit does not
allow you to cast Effects above your normal abilities!
Each trick costs three points, and must suit your character’s
metaphysical focus. You can take this Merit up to three times,
total. Obviously vulgar feats (making yourself disappear in broad
daylight) are prohibited, although a clever use of circumstances
(the old Batman disappearance trick – see How Do You DO
That?, p. 77) could be included in your bag of tricks.
This Merit is intended to give your character and chronicle
a little extra flair. It should not be allowed as an end-around to
skirt the rules, or as a secret weapon that he can use without
consequences like Paradox. Under unfamiliar and /or hostile
circumstances, like stirring someone else’s pot in someone else’s
kitchen, this Parlor Trick might not work at all.
Spirit Magnet (3 to 7 pt. Merit or Flaw)
Ephemeral entities flock to your presence. The essence of
who you are – benign or malignant – draws spirits to you, and
they, in turn, affect the essence of who you are. For the most
part, these entities cluster around you in the Penumbra, invisible
to mortal perceptions; whenever you cross the Gauntlet, though
(either with your perceptions or with your body), they’re waiting
for you there. Spirits that can manifest physical forms may come
across the Gauntlet to visit you, and those that cannot take on
physical bodies still energize the spiritual atmosphere in your
vicinity. Whether or not this is a good thing for you depends
upon whether you select this Trait as a Merit or a Flaw:
• The Merit form of Spirit Magnet draws generally benevolent spirits – Naturae, Lunes, totem and animal entities
of the gentler variety, and so on. These spirits protect
you from malignant entities, warn you of impending
danger, offer advice, help you out when you visit the
Otherworlds, and generally make your life easier. Folks
who can sense those spirits (mediums, shamans, medicine-folk, werecreatures, etc.) tend to favor you; after
all, if the better sorts of spirits like you, then you must
be someone worth knowing.
• The Flaw version represents the presence of malevolent spirits – Banes, demons, and other nasty Umbral
beasts. Summoned by curses or spiritual corruption,
these entities seek to tempt you, poison you, feed
off your vitality, and otherwise turn your life into a
self-contained Hell On Wheels. Spirit-sensitive folk
will avoid you unless they’re into that sort of thing,
and werewolves will consider you to be “of the Wyrm”
(whatever the hell that means), if only because of the
company you keep. Although you might not consider
yourself a bad person at heart, your spiritual companions say otherwise!
The value of this Merit of Flaw is, as always, based on how
helpful or troublesome the spirits can be, how powerful they are,
and how many of them you have to deal with when they appear.
• (3 points) Minor entities occasionally offer aid or
hindrance.
• (4 points) Minor entities show up frequently, or in small
numbers.
• (5 points) Minor entities surround you often, whether
you want them to or not, and more potent ones have
taken interest in your existence.
• (6 points) You have the interest of one or two entities
of significance, and plenty of minor ones pay great
attention to you.
• (7 points) You’re never alone, even when you probably
wish you could be.
This spiritual companionship could be directly opposed
to your true nature. A really awful person might attract benevolent entities who want to save her, while a veritable St.
Anthony could be plagued with demons intent on fucking up
his soul. Even so, such constant presence does have an effect
on your overall health. Mind, body, and spirit are interwoven74 The Book of Secrets
whether we want to recognize that or not, and a mortal who
attracts Otherworldly entities has got something unusual going
on under the skin.
Spirit Mentor (3 pt. Merit)
A ghost, Loa, or other ephemeral entity has taken a special
interest in you. As an expression of favor, this entity teaches you
things few mortals ever have the opportunity to learn. Although those
lessons do not include Sphere-based magick, you could learn insights
that help you to expand your knowledge and better understand the
nature of Reality. (See Raising or Learning Spheres in Mage 20,
p. 337.) More often, though, this entity tells you secrets, offers you
enigmas, and helps you work through situations that would leave
most mortals scratching their heads or crying in corners.
Your Spirit Mentor could also teach you new Abilities, or
help you improve the ones you have, if such teaching seems
appropriate to the spirit in question. A data-entity might be
able to teach you about computers, while an incarnation of
Zhengyi Zhenren’s tiger could teach you tiger-form kung fu.
Such teaching tends to take place in the Otherworlds, or in
dreams, rather than in the material realm, although a spirit who
can Materialize (as the Charm of that name) could certainly
teach a person in her own home realm.
As with other character-related Traits, your mentor is a
Storyteller character with its own agendas, personality, and
so on. This Merit could be combined with the Backgrounds:
Ally, Familiar, Mentor, or Totem to represent a spirit who
plays several roles in your life. Depending on how active your
ephemeral friend is in your everyday life, other folks might
know about this mentor, consider it to be “part of the family,”
or think you’re utterly out of your mind… and if that spirit
clashes with the company you keep (like a Loa hanging with a
Technocrat, or a demon with a Chorister), your friend might
get you into hot water on the human side of your life!
Supernatural Companion (3 pt. Merit)
You’ve got a friend among the Night-Folk: a vampire, a
changeling, a werebeast, a ghost, or some other entity who exists
outside the Sleeping Masses. This friend isn’t quite as reliable
as an Ally Background character, but can aid you if need be.
That door swings both ways, of course; your companion will
also call on you from time to time, and not always on the most
convenient occasions!
Folks (and Night-Folks) probably frown upon this friendship. Werewolves, for example, aren’t fond of you Caern-robbing
mage-types! That’s especially true if you’re a Technocrat who’s
buddy-buddy with one of those damned Reality Deviants, or
a Tradition mage who pals around with a bloodsucking fiend.
Yeah, this friendship is worth the trouble, but it can really be
a hassle at times. Whoever and whatever this friend might be,
the Storyteller creates and controls the character in question…
with all the strange priorities, conflicting needs, and secret
agendas that situation suggests.
Stormwarden /Quantum Voyager
(3 or 5 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 643.
Deathwalker (4 pt. Merit)
The Underworld welcomes you. While most Umbral
travelers are more or less barred from the Shadowlands and
Low Umbra unless they possess special magicks (or have died),
you can step sideways into the Dead Lands with a simple application of Spirit 3. When you do so, your aura assumes the
pale tone of death, and you become essentially indistinguishable from a ghost unless some knowledgeable entity makes a
successful Perception + Occult roll (difficulty 7) to see you for
what you really are. If the Avatar Storm is still raging in your
chronicle, you can pass into the Low Umbra without suffering
the Storm’s effects.
This sort of “gift” often leaves macabre traces on the mortals
it favors. Hence, this Merit is well-suited for the Flaws: Echoes,
Uncanny, and Primal Marks. Thanks to their innate ties to
the Dead Lands, Deathwalkers, as a rule, view the Otherworlds
through the Vidare Mortem, suffer from Morbidity Quiets,
and tend to have a rather fatalistic view of life.
Fae Blood (4 pt. Merit)
Your veins pulse with the enigmatic blood of the fae.
Although not a full changeling, you possess a distant tie to the
Dreaming by way of your strange heritage. In Changeling: The
Dreaming terms, you’re kinain: a mortal human related to their
kind. Your Banality rating is low (no higher than 4, and often
lower than that), and you remain permanently enchanted in
the sense that you perceive, and are affected by, the changeling
world. As a default member of that eldritch fellowship, you
also tend to get swept up in their odd intrigues, and know an
uncomfortable amount about their hidden world.
As with the Merit: Faerie Affinity, this Merit is forbidden
to technomancers of all kinds. Their Banality is too high to
sustain this gift of the blood.
Shapechanger Kin (4 pt. Merit)
Through a distant but noticeable quirk of lineage, you
share a touch of the Changing Blood. In plain English, you’re
related to one of the were-breeds: werewolves, werecats, werecrows, and so forth. This gift does not grant you their powers
or Gnosis, but you probably know a few secrets (in game terms,
Lore Knowledge) about your kin. You remain immune to the
primal-fear Delirium that affects most people in a werecreature’s
presence (not that mages suffer from it anyway); can travel in
the Otherworlds longer than most mortals manage, without
suffering theDisconnectionand Acclimation side-effects of such
travel (detailed in Mage 20, pp. 482-483); and possibly enjoy
some goodwill from your feral family, so long as you haven’t
done anything to piss them off. Their enemies, however, are
yourenemies, which makes this anextremelydouble-edged Merit.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 75
Twin Souls (4 pt. Merit)
To you, the term soulmate is literally true. Your Avatar has a
twin that has been embodied within another mortal body. That
other person (typically a human being, but potentially an animal)
shares your Nature and Essence, and possibly your Demeanor as
well. Even so, your “twin” can be a very different person – different
gender, different ethnicity, different culture, and again possibly
even a “higher” animal like a wolf, bear, hawk, bison, and so
forth. That person might live on the other side of the world, and
may not even know that you exist. If soul-twins meet in person,
though, both feel an unmistakable connection to one another. This
connection, however, might not necessarily translate to goodwill.
Blood-siblings often clash, and soulmates can clash as well.
If that twin is also a mage (many twin Avatars are not yet
Awakened), then both mages have the same Avatar rating. You
can both share Quintessence and cast spells together if you
happen to be physically touching (or, in the Umbra, ephemerally
touching). In this case, the character with the highest Arete
rating and Sphere Ranks is the one whose Traits get used to
cast those Effects. Both mages, when they’re within arm’s reach,
also get an amount of bonus Quintessence points that’s equal
to their Avatar rating; if Ryan Summers and his twin Sylvia
Jane have three dots in Avatar, they each get an additional three
points of Quintessence when they’re close enough to touch one
another. For details about collaborative spellcasting, see Acting
in Concert in Mage 20, pp. 542-543. Shared souls, however,
also share equally in any Paradox gathered by their magicks,
with each twin separately getting the full amount of Paradox. If
Ryan or Sylvia casts an Effect that earns 10 points of Paradox,
then both Ryan and Sylvia get 10 Paradox points each.
Whether or not your twin is a mage, you can use magick
to keep track of them once you’ve met your twin. A single dot
of Correspondence will let you know where your soulmate is, a
single dot in Life will let you know their current state of health,
and a single dot in Mind allows you to share thoughts with
one another. A twin’s death, however, is a shattering event; if
your twin dies, you must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 8) or
else suffer the psychic shock of Things Man Was Not Meant
to Know. Until that twin’s Avatar reincarnates (which might
not happen in your own lifetime), and is met in person once
again, you cannot use the shared powers you had once enjoyed.
As with other character-based Traits, your twin is not a
walking Merit but a character in their own right. Both twins
could be roleplayed by different players in the same group, and
probably should not be played by the same player. The quest to
find a soulmate, a bitter dispute between soulmates, two soulmates on opposing factions of the Ascension War – such stories
could provide the foundation for pivotal events and themes
in your chronicle. This Merit goes well with the Background:
Allies, the Merit: True Love, and the Flaws: Enemy, Sleeping
with the Enemy, and Ward. Because of the already-Awakened
natures of the Night-Folk, however, a soul-twin cannot be a
vampire, werecreature, changeling, or other paranormal entity.
Umbral Affinity (4 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, p. 644.
Unbondable (4 pt. Merit)
Your soul remains free from the vampiric blood bond, and
resistant to other forms of metaphysical fealty. Although you
may still be compelled into service through Sphere magick,
or impressed by dominating powers like vampiric Presence
or changeling Chicanery, your Willpower is considered to be
two dots higher with regards to resisting such domination.
(See Mage 20, p. 519, and Influence-Magick Difficulties and
Resistance, Recognition, and Duration in How Do You DO
That?, pp. 116-117.)
A rare and potent Merit, this gift may cost double its usual
cost in a chronicle that’s filled with vampires, especially if the
mages in that chronicle make a habit of guzzling vampire blood…
Ghoul (5 pt. Merit)
The blood of vampiric Kindred has made you something
more than human. Willingly or otherwise, you have supped
on a vampire’s blood, and although you’re probably not bloodbound to her service any longer (unless you are), that creature’s
unnatural vitality has become your own. Trouble is, you need
more vitae to sustain your uncanny abilities… and, as many
mages have discovered, such blood is exceedingly addictive.
A ghouled character ages very slowly, gets one automatic
success on any Strength-based roll, and inflicts one extra die
of damage with all hand-to-hand, non-magickal attacks. If
your chronicle employs Vampire: The Masquerade rules, your
character also has a blood pool, one dot in Potence, and the
potential to buy and employ Fortitude, Potence, and an ability
from the initiating vampire’s clan.
That’s the good part; the bad parts involve the constant
craving for more vitae, the loss of those supernatural bonuses
after roughly a month without vampire blood, several dots
in Resonance (or the Echoes Flaw, detailed in Mage 20, pp.
646-647) that reflect the corrupt nature of the undead, and
the obvious drawbacks of hanging around with vampires just
so you can drink their blood.
Clear Sighted (5 pt. Merit)
Even without employing your Arts, you have a preternatural gift for seeing things as they are, not as they appear to be.
Illusions, disguises, cloaking spells, and other forms of trickery
rarely deceive your eyes.
In game terms, you can make a Perception + Awareness
roll to see through metaphysical deception powers: vampiric
Disciplines, faerie cantrips, werecreature Gifts, Sphere-based
illusions, and other powers that are based on deceiving a witnesses’ perceptions. This roll works only against powers that deceive
the target’s perceptions, not against any other form of Gift, Discipline,
cantrip, and so forth. (Vampiric Obfuscate, for example, but not
Presence or Dominate.)76 The Book of Secrets
Mages, the Blood Bond, and the Effects of Vitae
As mentioned nearby, mages can become ghouls, enjoying the benefits of vitae powers at the cost of hunger and
the blood bond. A ghouled mage becomes a mystic addict, her thirst driving her to debase her higher calling. Even a
Nephandus avoids this state if she can help it. At best, the ghoul-thirst drives a mage to hunt and drain vampires – a
risky calling even for the most accomplished mystics!
More often, a ghouled mage becomes blood bound to the vampire from whom she feeds. Any character – mage or
otherwise – who drinks the blood of a certain vampire on three separate occasions becomes a blood-bound thrall
to that vampire. From that point onward, the character will do almost anything, short of obvious suicide, on behalf of
her regent. The regent can ask for, or even demand, service, and the thrall will feel compelled to fulfill that request.
If the regent tries to Dominate the thrall (using the vampiric Discipline of that name, as described in the Vampire:
The Masquerade rulebook), his difficulty is two levels lower than it would normally be. Good treatment deepens the
bond, and abuse lessens it but cannot fully dispel it. Only time, distance, and a significant effort of will can do that;
even then, a strong fascination remains.
Mages, willful creatures themselves, can try to resist the blood bond’s effects. If the mage tries to beat the bond, that
mage’s player needs to roll her Willpower against difficulty 8 and accumulate one success for each time the mage
has fed from that vampire (three successes minimum). If she makes that roll, the player must spend one Willpower
point each turn in order to resist the bond. The length of time for which the mage remains free depends upon what
she’s trying to do; if she’s simply plotting against the regent, the resistance can last a scene; if she’s trying to attack
him, the resistance lasts only a turn or two. After that, the compulsion returns – often mixed with a sense of regret for
having defied the master, and disgust at herself for having gotten into the situation to begin with.
Powerful magick can break the bond. Through a combination of Life 4, Mind 3, Entropy 3, and Prime 1 – plus at
least three dots in Lore (Vampires) – a mage can break the bond’s hold on another person (difficulty 8, successes as
above). A mage cannot, however, use that magick to break her own bond. One of the secret favors that the Order of
Hermes owes to the Verbena Tradition involves the Verbenae breaking blood bonds on several dozen Hermetic magi.
Even without the bond, a ghouled mage suffers a vicious addiction to vampire blood. In game terms, this counts as the
Addiction Flaw at its highest level, and she also becomes Deranged (again, as per that Flaw) through her obsession
with consuming more vitae. She enjoys the benefits of a typical ghoul, but she suffers the same pains, too.
As an optional rule, she might also suffer metaphysical corruption from that blood. If a mage remains ghouled – with
or without the blood bond – for one year for each point of Avatar + Arete, she begins to lose points from her Avatar
Background, at a rate of one point per year. Once the Avatar is gone, she begins to lose Arete… and after Arete is
gone, she loses the powers of Awakening forever. The thirst has consumed her soul… and for that reason, among
others, smart mages avoid the thirst for literal damnation.
The difficulty for that roll is generally 5 + the highest Sphere
Rank or other level involved in that power; a Forces 2 /Prime
2 illusion, then, would be difficulty 7, while a vampire’s Mask
of a Thousand Faces (Obfuscate 3) would be difficulty 8. If a
character could normally get a roll to see through the illusion
(as shown in How Do You DO That?, pp. 129-132), then your
character subtracts -3 from her difficulty when trying to do so.
Your clear sight also reduces your difficulty by -3 when you
try to see through a disguise, a cloaking spell or device, or other
attempts to conceal the truth from an onlooker. It does not,
however, allow you to see through darkness, notice stealthing
or invisible characters, or otherwise perceive something that
you would not be able to see without this Merit; combining this
Merit with the physical Merit: Acute Senses, however, could
make you a formidably perceptive character.
“Immortal” (5 or 7 pt. Merit)
Thanks to some uncanny gift, you age slowly (if at all) and
are extremely hard to kill. This gift comes not from Sphere
magick but from a metaphysical legacy or curse that transcends
the fleeting nature of the flesh. You’re not truly immortal, as
death will probably claim you eventually; by normal standards,
though, you exist outside of the usual range of human mortality.
This Merit features two levels:
• (5 points) You age very slowly – perhaps one year for
every passing decade – and eventually recover (at the
usual speed) from any injuries and illnesses that do
not immediately kill you outright. A wasting disease or
infection, for instance, won’t kill you (though you might
wish it would), but a bullet in the heart would do so.
• (7 points) In addition to the slow-aging process, you’re also
immune to death itself unless you meet yourspecial doom(as
described below) or have your body completely obliterated.
Shooting won’t kill you, poison won’t kill you, starvation
won’t kill you, but being incinerated or dissolved in acid
would end your life for good. Otherwise, your wounds heal
at the usual rate, eventually bringing you back from the
dead… which, if you’ve been buried, embalmed, entombed,
or otherwise trapped could be a very bad thing for you!Chapter One: Heroic Traits 77
Regardless of the level of this Merit, you must have at least
one special doom: an event that will kill your ass dead for good.
This doom could involve decapitation, burning of your body,
immersion in salt water, removal of the eternal revivification
unit installed within your heart, and so forth. This doom must
be determined before the chronicle begins, and if it ever befalls
you… well, life was fun while it lasted, right?
This Merit goes well with Traits like the Background: Legend, the Supernatural Merits: Mark of Favor, Nephilim, Spark
of Life, and Twin Souls, or the Supernatural Flaws: Phylactery
and Primal Marks. (See the appropriate entries throughout this
section.) It cannot be taken in addition to the Merit: Nine Lives
(also in this section) and, for obvious reasons, this Merit might
not be available to player characters within your chronicle at all.
Inner Knight (5 pt. Merit)
In your heart of hearts, you’re a hero. While your companions work toward their own selfish ends, you embody a
higher purpose. This purpose guides you in uncanny ways that
feel, at times, as if you’re being moved by a force greater than
yourself – a noble force, naturally, but one that transcends even
your personal Enlightenment. In dreams, you see yourself as a
Warrior of Reason, a Champion of Truth. A paladin. A genius.
A knight of everything that is worth defending.
Intended more for Technocratic operatives and skeptical
technomancers than for mages who accept reincarnation as a
metaphysical truth, this Merit grants you special gifts when it
seems like all hope has been lost. These gifts allow you to…
• access Traits you don’t possess, as per the Background:
Dream (at a rating of 5) but without entering a trance;
• add five temporary points to your Willpower Trait, to
use during that “hope is lost” crisis;
• …and perhaps recall things from a previous life that the
character could not possibly have known – a language
she does not know, an escape route in a place he’s never
visited, a person they’ve never met before, and so forth.
These boosts last only through the current scene, but
include a burst of vitalizing energy and a sense of your inner
hero coming through to save the day again.
This isn’t the sort of thing you talk about, of course, especially
not if you’re an agent of the Technocratic Union. The benefits,
though, cannot be denied, even if their source is clearly… well,
improbable, at best. And while this Merit was originally created
for the sourcebook Guide to the Technocracy, any mage with
a sense of higher purpose can take it. Just remember that the
biggest difference between a knight and a murderer is the side
of his sword you happen to be on at the time.
Legendary Attributes (5 pt. Merit)
Gifted with the strength of Shango or the beauty of Lucifer,
you may exceed the human capacity for one Attribute Trait.
That Trait is not automatically higher than usual (you still need
to spend points to raise the favored Attribute), but you may
purchase up to six dots in a given Attribute for your character,
exceeding the usual limit of five dots.
Beyond that higher maximum, you also get one heroic
capability that’s linked to that Attribute. The Shango-strength
mage might always inflict at least one health level of damage
with hand-to-hand blows, while the Luciferian seducer could
score an automatic success whenever he tries to charm someone
who ought to know better. These bonuses are always subject
to Storyteller approval, however, and they don’t kick in until
you reach six dots in the given Trait. Not even Lucifer, after
all, possessed his full charm when he was just a little devil…
Powerful Ally (5 to 8 pt. Merit)
You’ve got seriously badass friends – a vampire lord, a faerie
noble, a werewolf pack, Umbrood courtiers, or other similarly
magnificent entities. In most respects, this is the Supernatural
Companion Merit but with a much higher power-level… a
level which might be beyond the capacity of mages below the
Master rank. And while the Storyteller determines who your
friends are, what they can do, and what they want out of their
relationship with you, the value of this Merit depends upon
their relative benefit to you:
• (5 points) One buddy of considerable power and influence within his community – a Prince of the City, a
Garou elder, and so forth.
• (6 points) A small group of Supernatural Companions
(five or so), or an especially powerful representative of
his kind.
• (7 points) A larger group of Companions (around a
dozen), or two or three powerful friends.
• (8 points) Over a dozen Companions, a handful of
powerful friends, or one ally of near-godlike power.
Again, the Storyteller decides who these allies are, why
they’re interested in your goodwill, and what the cost of their
aid might be. You get nothing for nothing, after all, especially
not when such beings are involved! For a commensurate level
of enemies, see the Flaw: Immortal Enemy, p. 93.
Shattered Avatar (5 pt. Merit)
Your Avatar has been broken into pieces by some past-life
trauma. As a result, the part within you is incomplete… but that
situation can be rectified. If and when you locate the missing
pieces of your Avatar, you could make that inner spirit stronger.
In gamespeak, this Merit allows you to increase your Avatar
Background after character creation – a thing that cannot,
ordinarily, be done. (See Mage 20, p. 336.)
As with Twin Souls, above, this Merit provides plenty of
dramatic story hooks. The missing pieces of your Avatar might
be incarnated in other people; trapped in spiritual prisons78 The Book of Secrets
(Paradox Realms, demonic hells, soulsnares, enchanted gems, and so forth);
embedded in a tree in a garden that’s
warded by five dragons, and so on.
The quest for your soul-fragments
can be an epic part of your chronicle, with puzzles, twists, reversals,
betrayals, and battles for which
your soul is literally the prize.
This sort of thing might be hard
to reconcile with your beliefs
if, for example, you happen
to be a Technocrat. Still, until
you unite the missing bits of
your Avatar, there’ll be an
essential part of you that feels
incomplete.
The Storyteller should
determine exactly what it was
that shattered your Avatar,
and what you need to do
in order to reunite the
various bits into one spirit
again. Whether or not she
shares that information
with you is up to her – it
might be something you’ll
discover over the course of
the game. With each piece
restored, you add one dot
to your Avatar Background
rating, unless that Avatar was
embodied in another mage;
in that case, his Avatar rating
gets added to your own if you
manage to kill him… and if he
kills you first, then your Avatar
gets added to his own. (There
can, apparently, be only one.)
No matter how many
pieces are involved, however, the
Avatar Background maxes out at
5 dots. Although this Merit allows you to
raise your Trait’s rating, it does not allow
you to raise it above that level.
Spark of Life
(5 pt. Merit)
Blessed with great vitality, you heal injuries
with heroic speed and ease. Your own injuries
from lethal damage heal as if they were bashing
damage (see the Healing Damage chart in Mage
20, p. 406), and aggravated damage heals as if it
were one level higher than it is. (Wounded-level
damage, for instance, would heal
at the Injured-level rate.) Bashing
damage, regardless of its extent,
heals within an hour.
If you’re trying to heal someone
else, you subtract -2 from the difficulty of the roll, even if that roll involves
casting a Life Sphere healing Effect.
(The usual +3 maximum modifier
and minimum difficulty of 3 still
apply – seeMage 20,p.503.) As long
as you remain in physical touch
with the injured party, that
character uses your healing
rate as her own. Your touch
also soothes minor pains –
muscle spasms, headaches,
and so forth – within a
minute or two.
Beyond its healing powers, this rush of life-energy
simply feels good, too. Your
aura shines with bright
vitality, and your Resonance reflects your strong
connection to the primal
life-force. On the inevitable downside, vampires
find your blood delicious
– twice as potent as normal
human vitae (worth double the
usual blood points, for players of
Vampire: The Masquerade) – and
unspeakably refreshing.
Guardian Angel
(6 pt. Merit)
A powerful entity is watching over
you, providing advice, assistance, and
occasional protection when things get ugly.
Such aid is beyond your control (perhaps
even beyond your comprehension) and while
this “angel” has certainly supported your best
interests thus far, there could be a terrible pricetag attached to all this help. You think your
angel is of the better sort, but seriously – have
you read the lore about angels? Sweetness and
light are not among their more noted characteristics.
From a Merit perspective, this Trait provides occasional
help from the Storyteller. The nature of said help is entirely up
to the Storyteller, although it should be beneficial in at least the
short term. The help in question should also suit the nature of
the mage and her paradigm, although that suitability might turn
out to be rather ironic – an actual angel, for example, watchingChapter One: Heroic Traits 79
over an Infernalist mage, or a nature spirit protecting an avowed
Technocrat. The helpful party may be waiting for the mage to
“see the light,” honoring an ancient vow to the mage’s ancestors,
leading the protected party toward a new and unexpected Path,
or perhaps setting him up for a final revelation that could be
more terrible than the things the angel has been driving away.
From a Storyteller standpoint, we recommend playing
up the mysterious and potentially frightening nature of this
guardian “angel.” Legendary angels tend to be notoriously
bloody in their work, and can scare the living hell of mortals
even when their intentions are technically righteous. As a
Storyteller, determine who is helping the mage out, and why;
that information, of course, can be for you to know and your
players to wonder about. Whenever the angel manifests, play
up the implacable weirdness of such entities, couching their
appearances in eerie symbolism and elemental phenomena
(winds, fires, earthquakes, and so forth) whenever they appear.
(For suggestions, see Mage 20, pp. 356-359 and 363-367.)
Conversely, the angel could be an apparently mundane
person or animal who just happens to unleash hell on the
mage’s behalf. The animal spirits, minions, and elementals
described in Mage 20, Appendix I, represent the more sedate
end of the guardian angel spectrum; stranger beings could include protoplasmic globs, shimmering energies, horrific beasts,
and unnamable things that serve powers best undreamed of.
Even if the angel is exactly that – a messenger from the Biblical
God – such messengers can be pretty frightening. Check out
Ezekiel 1-10, Genesis 3, Revelations 4, and other awe-inspiring
manifestations. If the Powers That Be behind this guardian
angel are more along the lines of Pagan gods or cosmic horrors,
this unearthly Merit could unleash some rather scary things…
Nine Lives (6 pt. Merit)
Oh, you lucky bastard! Somehow, you manage to cheat
the Reaper with hair-raising regularity. If a die roll would result
in your character’s death, the person who made that roll must
roll again. If the second roll allows your character to live, then
you and /or your Storyteller mark off one of your nine “lives”
and your character survives the thing that would otherwise
have killed her. If that roll fails, then one “life” gets marked
off anyway and another roll is made. The rolls continue until
either the character survives or the lives get used up. As the
name suggests, however, this Merit lasts only nine times, tops.
And if the final die roll still results in your character’s death…
well, your luck was bound to run out sooner or later anyway.
Sphere Natural (6 pt. Merit)
For a single element of magick – the Sphere of your choice –
you enjoy an innate proficiency. The powers of that Sphere come
to you more easily than usual, and you advance faster in that
field of knowledge than you do in other Spheres. System-wise,
you pay 70% of the usual experience cost, rounded up, when
advancing in that Sphere. Naturally, such advancement costs
even less when you’re raising your Affinity Sphere.
Rank Cost /Affinity Sphere Cost
New Sphere: 7 pts.
2 6 /5 pts.
3 11 /10 pts.
4 17 /15 pts.
5 23 /20 pts.
The Mage 20 version of this Merit costs more than the version presented in previous editions because the cost of improving
Spheres with experience has gone down, and so the benefits
involved in this Merit have gone up. You may select this Merit
only once, for a single Sphere, and that Sphere should have some
intrinsic connection to your mage’s concept, backstory, and
magickal focus. This is, after all, an Art that comes naturally to
you, and so that predisposition should come through in many
different aspects of your character’s personality.
Avatar Companion (7 pt. Merit)
From lifetime to lifetime, you share a bit of your Avatar
with a companion who follows you through incarnations,
recalling more about their details than you do. Although
he’s not as powerful as you are, and lacks the metaphysical
prowess of the Merits: Twin Soul or Shattered Avatar (above),
this companion knows a great deal about your reincarnated
self… quite a bit more about it than you do. This loyal (if
not always agreeable) character literally follows you for life,
typically ending his life when you do; in the meantime, he
provides insights, advice, information about previous lifetimes, and whatever other forms of aid he can possibly offer.
Like the Merit: Guardian Angel, the Avatar Companion is
essentially a walking boost from your Storyteller, subject to
her whims but acting in your best interests… for the most
part, anyway.
Unless it’s purchased in addition to the Background:
Allies, your companion isn’t anything special; he could be
a person or animal, but not a vampire, a werebeast, or some
other Night-Folk entity. Your Avatar Companion could also be
a Ward, the focus of True Love, or perhaps an embodiment
of a Manifest Avatar. Treat him badly enough, and he might
become an Enemy. (See all appropriate entries for details.) As
with all other character-based Traits, this companion has his
own personality, desires, and so on. He may be loyal, but he’s
not suicidal, and isn’t likely to be thrilled if the mage decides
to abuse his loyalty!
Dual Affiliation (7 pt. Merit)
You’ve been initiated and trained in two different Awakened
groups. Perhaps you were a Verbena who gravitated toward the
Virtual Adepts, or a Man in Black who sought refuge among the
Templars. Whatever your history and affiliations might be, you’re
intimately familiar with both groups, have connections (not necessarily friends) in both groups, and may use and understand the
practices, tools and beliefs (in short, the focus) of either group.80 The Book of Secrets
Rules-wise, your mage enjoys the benefits of each affiliation. If he’s a former Technocrat who went over to the mystic
side, he can still use technomagick while transcending the
usual Technocratic bans regarding Arete and focus. When
raising a Sphere, your character gets to use the Affinity
Sphere rate for one Sphere per group. His former associates
probably don’t view him very favorably, though, unless he
“cross-trained” within friendly groups, like a Dreamspeaker
who went Ecstatic or a Hermetic who joined the Children
of Knowledge.
For additional details about this subject, see Chapter
Three’s Focus FAQ, p. 174.
Nephilim /Laham (7 pt. Merit)
Long ago, it has been said, immortals walked the
earth, siring offspring whose descendants still live among
us now. The Hebrew Bible refers to them as nephilim, an
ambiguous word that seems to be related to root words for
“fallen,” “prisoners,” and “overseers.” Later transliterations
refer to them as giants, monsters, watchers, and the fallen (or
violent) ones. Were they gods? Angels? Demons? Not even
the Awakened know for sure; you, however, have a bit of
High Umbral essence within you, and this nephilim inheritance – known sometimes by the demon-blooded name of
laham – marks you as something more than merely human
(Awakened or otherwise).
A living crossroads between the Astral Realm and the
mortal world, you exist in a heightened state of spiritual
essence. Your aura burns with unearthly intensity, and
your presence frightens many Otherworldly denizens. Your
connection to High Umbral entities might involve a distant
relationship to primordial sires, or the far more recent activities of mortals and spirits who shared a distinctly carnal
relationship. (“Mom, seriously – I need to know the truth about
Dad”) Are you part-demon? Descended from an angel? Sired
by an entity whose nature transcends mortal concepts like
“good” and “evil”? You probably don’t even know, although
events in your chronicle might reveal the truth whether you
want to learn it or not.
System-wise, this Merit confers the following drawbacks
and benefits:
• As noted above, your aura blazes with inhuman clarity
and brilliance.
• Your temperament favors your Umbral ancestor, and
you tend to act accordingly.
• You must take at least three points’ worth of Physical
Flaws to reflect the unstable nature of your physical form and the surging metaphysical energies it
contains. These Flaws do not count toward your
total Flaw points, nor do you get points for taking
those Flaws.
• Those energies give you a Quintessence rating of 7, and
those points automatically refresh up to that seven-point
maximum each time you go to sleep, regardless of your
Avatar rating.
• Ifyour chronicle employs theResonancerules inChapter
Two, you begin play with three points in Resonance,
not one. If not, you get three points’ worth of the Flaw:
Echoes. Again, those phenomena reflect the temperament of your Umbral ancestor.
• You subtract -1 from the difficulties of your casting rolls
when you cast Effects using the Mind Sphere, the Spirit
Sphere, or both in relation to the High Umbra. If, for
example, the demon-blooded laham mage Jenatrix wanted
to read someone’s mind, her casting difficulty would be
normal; if she wanted to project her astral self into the
High Umbra, however, she’d reduce the difficulty by -1.
• You can travel physically into the High Umbra by using
a Mind 4 /Spirit 3 Effect.
• When attempting to intimidate, command, or bargain
with High Umbral entities, you add two dice to whichever dice pool you happen to be using in that attempt.
(For details, see The Bargaining Process in How Do
You DO That? pp. 91-95.) Despite your advantage,
however, using your uncanny heritage as leverage will
not exactly endear you to the entities in question. In
such negotiations, it’s generally more constructive to
use a carrot than a stick.
• On a related note, you suffer a penalty of +2 to the difficulty of your rolls to resist, soak or counter rituals cast
by Hermetic High Ritual wizards or Awakened clerics
from the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian denominations.
These folks have spent millennia studying your kind,
and be ye angel or be ye demon, they know how to deal
with you more effectively than most mages do. (Byrituals,
we’re referring to extended-roll ceremonial magicks, not
off-the-cuff spells. Your chances are as good as anybody
else’s if a wizard tosses a lightning bolt at you; if he draws
up a summoning circle, though, you’re kinda screwed.)
• At the Storyteller’s option, you may also receive up to seven points in the Advantages described in Mage 20, p.
658 (and expanded further in the Mage 20 sourcebook
Gods, Monsters & Familiar Strangers). Demon-blooded
laham characters may, instead, take up to seven points
in the demonic Investments described in the Mage:
The Sorcerers Crusade sourcebook Infernalism: The
Path of Screams or the Mage 20 supplement The
Book of the Fallen. In either case, these additional
and optional benefits get balanced out with a five-point
Derangement Flaw of the Storyteller’s choice (see Mage
20, pp. 648-650).Chapter One: Heroic Traits 81
Although the player might not know what sort of entity
her character is descended from, the Storyteller ought to determine the character’s heritage, and then plant clues (dreams,
visions, weird greetings from characters who seem to know more
about the mage than she knows about herself…) throughout
the story. He ought to feed roleplaying notes to the player, too:
This Realm seems familiar even though you don’t recall having been
here before, You can almost taste the evil in that girl’s soul, Man, you
just wanna rip that dude’s throat out and you’re not sure why… The
player, of course, can draw her own conclusions – conclusions
that might not necessarily be accurate at all.
This Merit goes well with Merits likeLegendary Attributes,
Nine Lives, and Too Tough to Die, Flaws like Immortal Enemy, Primal Marks, or Cast No Shadow or Reflection, and
Backgrounds like Cult, Demesne, and Past Life. As with the
Merit: “Immortal,” (above) this Trait could be too powerful
for player characters to take. Supporting characters, however,
could be nephilim-descended, which would make for potent
friends and memorable enemies.
True Faith (7 pt. Merit)
See Mage 20, pp. 644-646.
Supernatural Flaws
The strangeness of Awakened life brings perils as well as
power. And while mortals occasionally suffer such bizarre fates
too, the following Flaws embody the uglier side of magick’s gifts.
As mentioned under the heading forSupernatural Merits,
several of the Flaws presented in earlier editions have not been
included below. Generally, that’s because they’re redundant with
other Traits; the old Flaw: Denial, for instance, is redundant
with its namesake form of Quiet, (described in Mage 20, pp.
556-557), while Touch of Frost is a manifestation of the Flaw:
Echoes. On the other hand, many of the revised Traits formerly
known as Adversarial Backgrounds (detailed at the beginning
of the Merits and Flaws section) have become Supernatural
Flaws, as described below under Jinx, Uncanny, and other
variable-point Flaws.
Anachronism (1 to 3 pt. Flaw)
Time has passed you by… or maybe it simply hasn’t
caught up with you yet. Your beliefs, personality, mannerisms,
fashion, and expectations are radically out of step with your
surroundings. This could be a deliberate affection on your part
(“The Old Days were better than today” /“Why wait for the future to
arrive when you can become the future?”), a Time Sphere-related
temporal hiccup or Paradox Flaw, the result of paranormal
longevity or back-tracking time travel, the manifestation of an
especially assertive past (or future) life… hell, even you might
not know quite why you’re like this, but you are, and the rest
of the world can’t help but notice.
The value of this Flaw depends upon the amount of trouble
you get into as a result of your anachronisms:
• (1 point) You seem a little weird, and potentially offensive (“Why are they not sitting in the back of the bus? Aren’t
there laws about that sort of thing?”), displaying quirks
from a recognizably different past or future that isn’t
radically behind or ahead of the current age. Add +1 to
the difficulty of understanding current technology and
modes of behavior.
• (2 points) You’re a relic of a distinctly earlier age, or the
harbinger of a seriously advanced one. The things you
say, wear, expect, and believe are disturbingly out of touch
with your surroundings, and can present significant
problems… especially if and when you hold forth on silly
little things like politics, social mores, sexuality, and the
law. Current technology puzzles you, either because it’s
inexplicably advanced or staggeringly primitive. Add +2
to the difficulty of all efforts to understand your current
era, including social rolls based upon getting along with
people in this age.
• (3 points) You hail from a time so distant that the current
era seems as alien to you as you seem to people of this
era. Hell, you might not even speak English (a common
trait of folks who existed before the expansion of British
and American influence in the 1800s), or speak your
language with an accent and idioms that essentially turn
it into another language entirely (think Shakespeare,
or Anthony Burgess’ novel A Clockwork Orange). Your
expectations regarding technology and social mores are
wildly divergent, and you could easily get yourself into
serious trouble. Add +3 to the appropriate rolls, and
you may be unable to process certain things (driving,
politics, current computer tech, etc.) at all.
Assuming you have a chance to acclimate to your surroundings, this Flaw can be bought down with experience points.
Until that time, your companions will have a lot of explaining
to do on your behalf!
Apprentice (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Most metaphysical societies, the Technocracy included,
employ a mentor /apprentice system. During a members’ early
years, an elder member is assigned to, or chooses to, teach
a new and inexperienced member. During the later days of
membership, an elder is expected to pass on their experience
to the younger generation. In addition to the usual training
programs a given group may purse, a new recruit often winds
up in the care of a seasoned member of that group. And in
the case of this Flaw, you’ve got a real winner on your hands.
When you mentor an apprentice a mentor, you’re responsible for someone (whatever his formal title might be) who makes
your life difficult. You can’t just kick this person to the curb,
but must instead provide discipline, guidance, training, and
quite often a support system (room, board, research space, and
so forth) so that the newbie can become a successful member82 The Book of Secrets
of your sect. An apprentice, however, is not a houseplant; even
the most cooperative apprentices demand time and attention,
and their deeds – good and otherwise – reflect upon your own
social status. The more troublesome ones, by extension, can
drive a mentor toward curmudgeonly solitude.
As a Flaw, this Trait reflects the range of potential apprentices and the effect they have upon your life:
• (1 point) A cooperative and dedicated ideal student
who takes up very little of your space and time, reflects
well upon you, and seems eager to learn from you while
being reluctant to argue very much.
• (2 points) A typical student who needs a fair amount
of hand-holding; makes occasional mistakes of protocol
and discipline; and takes up a fair amount of time, space
and patience. Even so, this person remains attentive and
more or less respectful, providing plenty of reasons for
you to be proud of him.
• (3 points) A rather clueless student whose presence
consumes a significant amount of time and attention.
This apprentice can be clumsy, obnoxious, thick-witted,
and occasionally problematic in social situations and
training exercises. He’s got promise, but it’s going to
take a lot of work to get him to realize his potential.
• (4 points) A seriously challenging student whose behavior and dedication leave a great deal to be desired. This
apprentice may have talent, but the burdens begin to
outweigh the potential benefits of his instruction.
• (5 points) An obstinate, haughty, disrespectful ass whose
presence is more trouble than it’s worth. Dangerous to
himself and everyone around him (yourself included),
he’s a disgrace to the society you share. Why are you
training this person, again? There might be a light at
the end of the tunnel someday, but it’s gonna take a lot
of work and sacrifice before this apprentice amounts to
anything more than a waste of your time.
Again, this is a person for whom you are responsible.
Unless you dedicate lots of time, attention, and often monetary resources toward bettering his condition, your apprentice
could get worse as time goes on. Conversely, you might be able
to mold a troublesome apprentice into an exemplar of your
society. From a game-system standpoint, you can lower the value
of this Flaw through dedicated work – the obstinate five-point
troublemaker could eventually become a one-point ideal student
if you put in the time, work, and roleplaying to make him so.
Storytellers: Allow your player to buy this Flaw down through
experience if and when she makes an effort to straighten up
a problematic apprentice, but also feel free to raise the Flaw’s
drawbacks if the player lets things slide too often and too far.
Despite the usual preconceptions of age and experience,
an apprentice could be older than his mentor. He may have
originally belonged to a different sect (say, a Verbena defecting
to the New World Order or Bata’a), and has a head full of ideas
about how things “should” be done – ideas that run counter to
your own teachings. Or he might be a new mage who Awakened
in middle age, and who therefore has problems taking orders
from an experienced mage he considers to be a kid. Even the best
students make mistakes, and so no level of this Flaw is without
headaches – that, after all, is why it’s considered a Flaw!
Once again, this character-based Trait represents a full-fledged
Storyteller character whose personality, needs, problems, and
agendas make him far more than just a list of dots on a character
sheet. In an experienced roleplaying trope, you might let another
player run this apprentice, as either a supporting character or as
their main mage. In such cases, of course, the student will be less
powerful and experienced than the teacher, unless he began his
Awakened life as a mage from a different group. In any case, the
apprentice ought to be a major part of the chronicle, and may
eventually even become the center of the tale (as in the Harry
Potter saga) if and when the apprenticeship goes well. A rotten
apprenticeship, on the other hand, could still earn that character a
starring role in the chronicle: as an antagonist whose close history
with the mage just makes the fight nastier for everyone involved.
The Bard’s Tongue (1 pt. Flaw)
A curse has rendered you unable to lie. It may even compel
you to speak the truth when you struggle to remain silent. Worse
still, you tend to say things that later turn out to be true even if
you hadn’t known anything about them at the time. (“Don’t try
and score food from that guy over there – he’s got a gun and is having
a really bad day.”) You often get a certain “look” when the urge
to speak truth comes up, and folks who know you have begun
to recognize the signs of a forthcoming “honesty blast” before
you even open your mouth.
Life and Mage chronicles are both filled with times when
it’s best to keep a lid on the truth. And so, in order to avoid
saying speaking the proverbial inconvenient truth (or worse),
you need to spend a Willpower point to keep your mouth shut
about it. Repressing that truth may also cost you one health level
in bashing damage if the truth you’re clamping down on is one
of those “things that really must be said” which isn’t a smart
thing to say under the circumstances. (“Yeah, Agent Courage,
everybody knows you work every angle with every group – that’s not
exactly a ‘secret,’ now is it?”)
Cast No Shadow or Reflection
(1 to 2 pt. Flaw)
According to certain legends, witches cast no shadow. And
while that isn’t true of most mages, it’s somehow true for you.
Maybe you suffer from a lingering Paradox Flaw, manifest your
own cultural fears, or made a bargain that cost you your shadow
or reflection. In any case, your shadow and /or reflection are
absent from your presence. For one point, you’re missing one of
those things, for two points you lack them both, and although
most folks won’t notice this consciously, they do tend to feelChapter One: Heroic Traits 83
uneasy in your presence even if they’re not sure why. (Technological machines record this phenomenon, too.) Add +1 to the
difficulty of all your Social-Trait rolls under most circumstances,
and +2 to the difficulty if a witness makes a perception-based roll
(difficulty 7) and figures out why you seem so weird.
Cursed (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, p. 646.
Devil’s Mark (1 pt. Flaw)
A pact or some other metaphysical occurrence has left you
with what old-school witch-hunters consider a “devil’s mark”: a
minor but noticeable deformation that remains insensate to pain
and yet allows a creature to draw your Quintessence out through
your body in physical form. Despite preconceptions, the origins
of this mark might not have come from a pact with some infernal
entity. That fact doesn’t keep people – Sleepers and otherwise –
from looking askance at you if and when this mark can be seen,
especially since there’s often something disconcerting about the
way it appears – a third nipple, a red or black growth, a vaguely
demonic face or sigil embedded in your flesh, and so forth.
Thankfully, you don’t have to worry too much about
witch-hunters in the technologically industrialized world.
(Other regions are a different story; even rural areas of socalled advanced nations still hold people who will harm or
kill someone who’s “different.”) The mark’s disconcerting
appearance, though, may lead you to cover it up anyway. Folks
who do believe old-fashioned ideas about “witches” will not take
kindly to that devilish brand, so it could become a real problem
under the wrong circumstances. On the plus side, however,
you actually can nurture a Familiar (as in the Background
Trait of that name) on the mark, and do so without physical
discomfort. Of course, the idea of a talking, midnight-blue
winged tarantula taking hits of Quintessence off your body
may be uncomfortable in its own right.
Echoes (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
See Mage 20, pp. 646-647.
Paranormal Prohibition or Imperative
(2 to 8 pt. Flaw)
Also known as Geasa and Magical Prohibition or Imperative, this Flaw represents a thing you either must do, or are
forbiddenfrom doing, on pain of awful consequences. Generally,
this imperative comes from an oath you swore, a curse that was
inflicted upon you, or a legacy that follows your family lineage.
Faerie grudges, infernal pacts, godly inheritances, ancient prophecies, Fortean quirks of physics… any one of them can inflict
such a burden upon you. So long as you never cross that line,
you should be okay – and may, in fact, possess some blessing
(a Merit or Background Trait) that’s linked to this Flaw. Ah,
but life has a way of pushing us to do things we don’t want to
do, and that’s especially true in the case of people who have a
curse or geas upon their heads!
The value of this Flaw is based on your chances of violating the prohibition, and the consequences that occur if /
when you do:
• (1 point) You break the prohibition only with an easily
avoided circumstance (never kill a cat, go to London, or
have sex with a married person), or find it easy to fulfill
your imperative (you must shave all your hair off, walk
outside every day, or wear blue clothing).
• (2 points) Your prohibition is easy to break (never tell
a lie, leave your home town, or have sex with anyone),
or your imperative is challenging to fulfill (you must
always cover your head, walk at least three miles every
day, or go barefoot at all times).
• (3 points) It’s very hard to not break your prohibition
(never speak, have a home of your own, or fall in love
or lust with anyone), or to honor your imperative (you
must blindfold yourself every day even though you
can see, walk everywhere you go, or remain naked at
all times).
• (+1 point) Inconvenient consequences – you botch your
next three rolls, suffer a migraine, develop a rash for
several days, etc.
• (+2 points) Annoying consequences – you lose your
voice for a day, lose a die from all your pools for a week
due to constant pain, add +2 to all your social rolls
with members of your faction until you can atone from
breaking your oath, and so forth.
• (+3 points) Painful consequences – until you can atone,
you go blind or mute, lose one dot from an Attribute,
lose an Ally, Mentor, or Familiar, take the Flaw:
Oathbreaker (below), or suffer a similarly awful fate.
• (+4 points) Crippling consequences – until you atone,
your Avatar abandons you, you lose a total of three dots
from various Attributes, you take the Flaws:Oathbreaker,
Deranged or both, or else endure a related punishment.
• (+5 points) Fatal consequences – either you’re gonna
die soon, you’ll be whisked off to an Otherworldly
punishment Realm, or both. Atonement, if it’s even
possible, will be very harsh, so do NOT break this oath
or forsake this imperative!
This Flaw makes an excellent companion to numerous
Backgrounds (Familiar, Legend, Past Life, Totem, Wonder,
and potentially others at the Storyteller’s discretion) and Merits
(pretty much anything, really, depending on how you define
the source of that Merit). Although this does not reduce the
cost of that Trait (despite the description of this Flaw in Mage
Revised, which employed a complex and potentially abusive
rule system that’s not found in other World of Darkness games),84 The Book of Secrets
a Prohibition /Imperative can represent vows, obligations, and
/or legacies associated with the beneficial Trait. If, for example, Riordan Manseragh were to have sworn a mystic oath in
order to win his tiger-spirit familiar, that oath would represent
a Paranormal Imperative, with painful consequences (the loss of
his Familiar Background) if he breaks his promise.
Your Prohibition /Imperative must be tied in with your
character’s backstory, and probably has a connection to all
three elements of her magickal focus (paradigm, practice,
and instruments). The conditions must be something that
could conceivably present an obstacle for your character (no
prohibitions, for example, against having sex with Voormas, or
imperatives to get out of bed in the morning), and your Storyteller will, of course, make a point of throwing said obstacles
in your path at various points during the chronicle. That said,
we also urge Storytellers not to abuse this Flaw, or to apply it
out of proportion with the points the Flaw is worth.
Although it’s rather unusual, a technomancer could have
a metaphysical pact or prohibition too. She may, for instance,
need to work on a Mac, employ only steamtech, or invent all
of her own technology to avoid suffering some paranormal
malaise. Thus, this Flaw is not always “mystical” in nature, even
if the line separating mysticism from paranormal phenomena
is more a matter of semantics than of metaphysical principles.
Gremlin (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
There’s a perverse imp running around your home. Okay,
maybe it’s not an actual imp – it could be a malfunctioning
robot companion, a vain and selfish bioconstruct, a troublesome spirit, an obnoxious beast, that talking winged tarantula
we mentioned a few entries ago… the form of the creature
is unimportant. Like the above Flaw: Apprentice, this Trait
reflects a companion character who, despite being supposedly
on your side, remains a constant pain in your ass.
Originally presented as the adversarial Background for
Familiar, this Flaw becomes more significant as the power of
the creature, and its attendant nuisance, grows:
• (1 point) A creature of unusual, but minor, ability, which
busies itself with trivial annoyances.
• (2 points) An entity whose power and intellect (or at least
its cunning) make your life frustrating but not actively
hazardous.
• (3 points) A being of notable power whose mischief has
begun to shade into actual damage to your property,
health, status, and relationships.
• (4 points) A metaphysical pain in the tuchus whose
powers cause lasting harm to you and to the things you
consider precious.Chapter One: Heroic Traits 85
• (5 points) A walking plague of significant power and
malignancy. Said critter might not actually mean to be
bad, but its effects on your life are inescapably destructive.
As with an Apprentice Flaw, above, you bear a certain
amount of responsibility to this creature – it’s not simply your
enemy, or even a nemesis, but a being with whom you share a
vital bond. Also as per the Apprentice Flaw, your treatment of
this “gremlin” (a legendary being that sabotaged airplanes for
fun) may reduce or intensify the value of this Flaw. A formerly
malignant entity could be tamed and eventually become a Familiar (as in that Background), while a poorly-treated familiar
might become a gremlin, and a previously annoying gremlin
could be annoyed into becoming a serious threat to the mage
and his surroundings. As an optional rule, you might even – with
Storyteller approval – be able to purchase the Gremlin Flaw in
addition to the Familiar Background, to reflect a helpful yet
perpetually troublesome companion.
A gremlin, as with all other Trait-based characters, is an
entity in its own right. Chances are good that the trouble it
causes for your mage has an understandable foundation – a
reason that seems inexplicable to the mage yet remains perfectly
reasonable to the gremlin. A mage who explores the reasons
behind this misbehavior may calm her temperamental companion; then again, an attempt to understand the gremlin’s
grudge might only piss it off further…
Locked Vidare (1 pt. Flaw)
Mages view the Otherworldly Penumbra through a metaphysical perspective called the Vidare. Most of them can alter
that perspective by changing their point of view. Not you. For
you, the Periphery remains “locked” into a single perspective:
the glittering clarity of the Vidare Astral, the primal luminosity
of the Vidare Spiritus, or the rotting deathscape of the Vidare
Mortem. Essentially, your metaphysical perspective is frozen
in place. This is literally the way you view the world around
you, and that view never really changes. (For details about the
Vidare and the impressions they present, see Mage 20, pp. 82,
89, 94-95, 98-99, and 474.)
In addition to shaping the way your Storyteller describes the
Vidare to you, and guiding your reaction to what you perceive,
this Flaw also influences your personality, your sense of fashion,
your philosophical and metaphysical paradigms, your magickal
focus, and so on. When you perceive things in a certain way,
after all, that perspective tends to color most aspects of your life.
Strangeness (1 pt. Flaw)
Your metaphysical prowess occasionally warps reality in
your presence, even when you don’t want it to do so. Weird
stuff happens when you’re not expecting such phenomena, and
those quirks of strangeness seem to be rooted in the sort of
magick you pursue. A specialist in Entropy could suffer twists
of probability and decay; a Life-attuned healer discovers odd
growths and mutations in the life-forms around him, while a
Forces-gifted mage bends the physics in his general vicinity.
These phenomena ebb and flow without your guidance or
control. Perversely, the more skilled you become in magick,
the stronger these tides of weirdness become.
System-wise, the Storyteller determines, once or twice per
game session, to roll your Arete against difficulty 6. If the roll
succeeds, the Storyteller throws in some random occurrence
that’s based on a Sphere you possess – most often, on your
Affinity Sphere. Grass could grow suddenly, mirrors could crack,
psychic impressions could inform you of the sexual habits of the
person standing next to you in the elevator – that sort of thing.
If the roll fails, then nothing unusual occurs. If the roll
botches, however, then a Paradox backlash expels one point
of Paradox in your current pool for each dot you have in
your Affinity Sphere; or all of your current Paradox, if you
have fewer points than that in your Paradox pool. (If, as an
example, Jinx has three dots in Entropy but only one point
of Paradox, the backlash dispels that one point in a backlash.)
These small backlashes won’t be terribly damaging, but given
the unpredictable nature of this Flaw, they could come at very
inconvenient times.
Throwback (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Haunted by a past life (often as per the Background
Trait of that name, described above), you suffer from awful
memories and act out in ways that are, shall we say, not productive to your current incarnation. Perhaps you still loathe
the clergymen who tortured a former “you” for witchcraft 400
years ago; the smell of cooking meat still sends you into panic
attacks. Or you’ll get vertigo and acrophobic surges from that
time a previous incarnation fell off a castle wall. You may slip
into archaic accents, foreign languages, or terminology that is
not exactly au courant (or socially acceptable) in today’s world.
Flashbacks, time segues, inappropriate behavior – it’s all part
of the package in this life you lead today.
For each point in this Flaw, up to a maximum of five points
(and dice), the Storyteller will roll one die against difficulty 8
when the potential arises for a past life to affect your present
life. The more successes he rolls, the more that past life affects
you. The symptoms of this “throwback syndrome” generally
depend upon the Storyteller’s whim, but you could collaborate with him to hash out a backstory (or several backstories)
for the previous incarnations your character recalls, and then
roleplay symptoms that seem appropriate to those histories. For
especially strong flashbacks (three successes or more), you may
need to roll your Willpower (again, difficulty 8) to suppress the
reaction to what your character recalls.
Described in Guide to the Traditions as an adversarial
Background of Past Life, this Flaw makes a fitting companion
to that Background, the Dream Background, and to other
Merits and Flaws related to reincarnation (Twin Souls, Shattered Avatar, and similar Traits described within this section).
With a few appropriate changes to the symptoms, you could
also describe the Throwback Flaw as manifestations of a Legend Background, or as memories from a life that goes back86 The Book of Secrets
several centuries. You’d rather forget the things you did, and
endured, back during the Conquest of the Americas, but you
never really can.
Uncanny (1 to 5 pt. Flaw)
No matter how unobtrusive you try to be, you remain remarkably memorable to anyone who encounters you. You’re the
very opposite of “arcane,” which is why this Flaw was originally
described as an adversarial Background for the Trait of that
name; rather than moving through life with near-invisibility,
you stand out like a HIT Mark at a Verbena barbeque.
Why are you memorable, exactly? Is it an inhuman glow
behind your eyes? An unsettling tone in your voice? A metaphysical miasma that hangs about you despite your apparently
mundane appearance? Does grass grow or die in your shadow?
Maybe dogs cower when they sense your approach. There could
be a low buzzing in your presence, like a chorus of flies, or a
disconcerting crackle of electricity that radiates from your
skin, disrupting electrical systems in small but noticeable ways.
Whatever it is that causes people to remember you, that facet
of your presence is a constant reminder that you are not like
other folk.
Once again, the point-value of this Flaw depends upon
the extent to which it interferes with your life:
• (1 point) You stand out in a crowd.
• (2 points) It’s pretty hard to conceal your oddities.
• (3 points) People remember you long after you’re gone.
• (4 points) You creep people out simply by existing.
• (5 points) You scare people simply by existing.
By its nature, this Flaw represents an unmistakable impression. Each point in this Flaw adds one die to the dice pool of
anyone who’s trying to notice you, recognize you, or penetrate
your attempts at stealth or concealment. (You didn’t really think
those wailing damned souls were gonna shut up just because
you were trying to get past the guards, now did you?) You may,
however, attempt to cover up your uncanny presence with a
roll of Intelligence + Subterfuge, assuming you have a method
of doing so – it’s easier to conceal your glowing red eyes with
sunglasses than to get those wailing damned souls to piss off
for a few minutes! The difficulty of such attempts is generally
5 + the value of your Uncanny Flaw; if, for instance, the clever
bioconstruct Victoria Carliotti gets two points in Uncanny for
her too-perfect skin, rippling muscles, and impossibly green eyes,
her concealment difficulty would be 7. That said, this Flaw does
not increase the difficulty of social rolls and may, depending
on what you’re trying to do, decrease such difficulties instead
(Storyteller’s option).
Despite the potentially grotesque nature of this Flaw,
your uncanniness doesn’t necessarily have to mean that your
physical features are fearsome in themselves. An inhumanly
gorgeous or disturbingly ordinary person can be Uncanny in
their own ways. This Flaw makes an excellent companion to
a variety of Physical Merits and Flaws – Enchanting Feature,
Hyperflexible, Hideous, and so forth – and fits in with Backgrounds like Legend, Past Life or Totem quite well too. (See
the appropriate entries for details.)
Although the Flaw: Echoes can manifest similar odd
phenomena, this Flaw reflects a constant and recognizable
distinction. While it probably embodies certain elements of
your metaphysical practices, it’s not tied to your Resonance or
activities – it’s an innate part of who you are. Your uncanniness
could represent physical features (hulking physique, metallic
skin, eyes that reflect eternity, and so forth); metaphysical
quirks (an unearthly aura, echoing disembodied voices, a
chilling radius around you, etc.); weird companions (a parade
of pink-winged kittens, smoldering butterflies, howling coyote
spirits, or similar inexplicable critters). Essentially, any sort of
localized kink in normalcy’s tail could be considered a sign of
your Uncanny nature. By “uncanny,” incidentally, we don’t
necessarily mean “supernatural.” The unnatural stillness of a
Black Suit, the flawless skin of a Victor, the predatory charisma
of a Syndicate “magic man” – they’re all examples of uncannily
Enlightened technology.
Vulnerability (1 to 7 pt. Flaw)
Some perilous substance may spell your doom. Thanks to
a paranormal weakness – a curse, a Paradox Flaw, a quirk of
belief or cultural legends – you suffer extraordinary harm from
that malignant material. Perhaps you shrivel up in sunlight,
flee from the scent of roses, or melt when obnoxious farm
girls throw water in your face. This substance isn’t generally
fatal to most folks (Awakened or otherwise), but it’s potential
death for you.
Your vulnerability to this substance in question has two
potential levels:
• Weakening, which inflicts one aggravated health level
on your character every turn she’s in contact with the
substance; and…
• Mortal peril, which inflicts three aggravated health levels
for each turn she’s in contact with the substance.
The value of this Flaw is based upon two factors: How
common the fatal substance is, and how badly it affects you:
• (2 points) You can be mortally wounded by contact
with something that’s almost impossible to acquire (the
sound of Pan’s pipes, a splinter from the True Cross),
or weakened by a very rare substance (a chunk of moon
rock, the tooth from an aged lion).
• (3 points) Mortal injury from a very rare substance, or
weakness caused by something that’s relatively scarce
and not obviously harmful (saffron, grave dirt, a raven’s
feathers).Chapter One: Heroic Traits 87
• (4 points) Mortal injury from something that’s relatively
scarce, or weakness from a common substance (rainwater,
silver, a baby’s cry).
• (5 points) A common substance inflicts mortal injury
on you.
• (+1 point) You die instantly upon contact with the
substance in question.
• (+1 point) The mere presence of the substance means
instant death to you.
• (-1 point) The substance must first inflict damage on
you through a typical injury (a stab wound, ingested
poison, a silver bullet) before it can harm you.
Damage from this Flaw cannot be soaked unless you’re
wearing an appropriate type of armor to prevent exposure
to that substance. (Being aggravated damage, it shouldn’t
normally be soaked anyhow, but mages have ways of getting
around such trivialities.) Your backstory should feature the
reason for your potentially fatal vulnerability to this substance.
That vulnerability ought to be tied into your magickal focus,
too – an Alpha Male tycoon isn’t likely to burn upon contact
with holy water, although it might be fun to fling a few dashes
of the stuff around Wall Street and find out for sure! (That
would certainly explain a few things.)
Bizarre Hunger (2 to 5 pt. Flaw)
You prefer – maybe even need – to eat weird shit… quite
possibly in a literal sense of that expression. Perhaps you’ve
sworn a vow, suffered a curse, been treated (or created) with
unhallowed rituals or arcane hyperscience, or initiated into
an occult fellowship with… interesting admission demands. In
any case, you must consume substances that may be degrading,
unpleasant, expensive, or downright illegal.
The more inconvenient the substance, the more this Flaw
is worth:
• (2 points) Easy to procure, though not as easy to devour
(paper, fresh eggs, poop, etc.).
• (3 points) Unpleasant, hazardous, and perhaps illegal
to consume (rotten meat, swamp water, raw cannabis,
and so forth).
• (4 points) Specialized, foul, criminal, and /or expensive
chow (human blood, custom-brewed potions or meals,
and the like).
• (5 points) You really shouldn’t eat such things… but
you must (live humans, toxic sludge, gold dust, highly
specialized food-like concoctions, and other similar
forms of sustenance).
For each dot in your Stamina Trait, you can go one day
without satisfying your special dietary requirements. After that,
you lose one health level per day until you either consume
your particular substance, or else die of hunger or thirst, suffer the punishment of a vow unfulfilled, or otherwise endure
whichever other consequences might result from denying your
bizarre hunger.
For a related (and probably essential) companion Trait,
see the physical Merit: Cast-Iron Stomach, p. 36. And for a
potentially related focus-instrument, see the Chapter Three
Expanded Instruments entry for Cannibalism, pp. 206-207.
Blood-Hungry Soul (2, 3 or 5 pt. Flaw)
In a previous incarnation, you had been a ghoul in thrall
to an unholy addiction to vampiric blood. Now, you must
resist the call of that ravenous past life and its fixation on
intoxicating Kindred vitae.
The deeper your thirst for this damning fulfillment, the
more this Flaw is worth:
• (2 points) You recall the glorious temptations of the
blood, but remember it like a poor choice from long
ago. If the opportunity presents itself to you, however,
you’ll need to make a Willpower roll (difficulty 5) in
order to resist the urge to pursue that addiction again. If
you succumb to that temptation again in this life, your
difficulty to resist further temptations rises to 6 every
time the chance to consume such blood arises again.
• (3 points) That temptation is stronger. Now the roll to
resist that first taste is 6, and the roll to resist further
crimson snacks becomes 8.
• (5 points) You’ve got it bad. Really bad! Obsessed with
the memories of glorious mystic blood, you must beat
difficulty 8 in order to resist your old habits, and difficulty 10 each time you try to deny that thirst after you’ve
fallen back to that damned addiction again.
This is so not going to end well… See the sidebar Mages,
the Blood Bond, and the Effects of Vitae, p. 76, for the longterm effects of such fatal addictions.
Crucial Component (2 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Your metaphysical practice demands specialized instruments. It’s not simply that you need fuel for your hypermodded
Porsche 911 Turbo S – you need your own specially prepared
blend of fuels, or the car won’t go. A simple rowan wand will
not suffice – your spells demand a hand-carved branch cut from
an unscarred rowan tree at high midnight on Samhain Eve. In
game terms, at least one of the instruments in your magickal
focus must be specifically created, harvested or modified to
work with your magicks. No lesser tool will suffice.
How hard is it to procure or employ this specialized component? That depends on the value of the Flaw:
• (2 points) Easy to procure and /or employ (sunlight,
yoga postures, motor oil, strong emotions, a book88 The Book of Secrets
commonly found in the New Age section at your local
bookstore, etc.).
• (3 points) Challenging to procure, employ, or replace
(open flames, the Kurmasana posture, professional
racing oil, genuine sorrow, an out-of-print occult text,
and so on).
• (4 points) Pretty damned hard to obtain, employ, and
replace (liquid fire, the Vrschikasana pose, alchemically
formulated oil, deep-core grief, a genuine Roman text
of De Daemonum Socrates by Apuleius, and other rare
and precious instruments).
• (5 points) Unique, obscure, forbidden, cumbersome, or
some combination of those four (a bottle of alchemically
distilled sunfire, an impossibly complex yoga posture
invented by the practitioner, personally formulated and
distilled hypertech lubricating oil, the heartfelt scream
of a grieving mother, a woodcut-illustrated Renaissance
Grimoire of Honorius inscribed on flayed human skin,
and similarly rarified instruments).
When used, the chosen instrument functions as a Personalized Instrument (Mage 20, pp. 503 and 587) – possibly a
Unique Personalizedone in the case of a five-point component.
In your case, however, you cannot employ the magick that’s
connected to that instrument at all unless you’re also able to
employ that particular instrument. If Lee Ann Milner depends
upon a unique vengeful centipede yoga posture in order to
employ certain Forces Effects through her yoga practice, then
Lee Ann is SOL unless she can assume that posture in time
to deploy the necessary Effects.
In the original version of this Flaw, the material was bound
to a specific Sphere Effect. This revised version ties the Crucial
Component to a tool you employ. This change makes it easier
to keep track of the component and its uses, employing the
new focus rules presented in Mage 20, Chapter Ten, so that
the Flaw becomes an integral part of the way your mage performs magickal Effects. For details about Assigning Practices
and Instruments to Effects, see the section of that name in
Chapter Three, p. 169.
Faulty Enhancements (2 to 5 pt. Flaw)
Well, crap. The warranty on your cybernetic gear has
expired (assuming, of course, that it ever had such assurances
in the first place), and now you’re stuck with malfunctioning
hardware that has literally gotten under your skin. Does your
BCI keep crashing? Do your legs keep seizing up? Is your bioware
constantly trying to eject your iron? Whatever the problem might
be, this Flaw gets rated by the amount of misery it causes you:
• (2 points) You suffer constant disorientation and pain.
• (3 points) The malfunctions keep you in such severe
discomfort that you need to take specialized medication,
or employ other forms of pain relief, at least once a day.
Failure to do so costs you one die from all dice pools
until the problem is rectified.
• (4 points) Your Enhancements fail you at critical times
(generally on a botched roll), crash or freeze up, and
must then be repaired by a technician who understands
the gear you’ve got.
• (5 points) That shitty gear consistently conks out when
you need it most. Roll one die against difficulty 7
whenever you employ cybertech in some important way
(lifting heavy things with bionic arms, sensor-scanning
for enemies, deflecting incoming enemy spells, and so
forth). If you succeed, then the Enhancements function
normally; if you fail, they fail and must be rebooted; if
you botch, they lock up or shut down until a skilled
technician manages to repair them.
Obviously, this Flaw means nothing unless you’ve got the
Background:Enhancements. Although such glitches occur with
Technocratic bioware, they’re far more common in cybernetics
that have been installed by factions whose people haven’t maintained a systemic and standardized approach to human upgrades
for the last few centuries. Wonky Etherites and overambitious
Virtual Adepts invent crappy iron all the time, and so this Flaw
is especially appropriate for cyborgs from those zealously individualistic Traditions, as well as for ex-Technocrats who’ve managed
to go rogue and survive the experience thus far.
Jinx /Infernal Contraption (2 to 10 pt. Flaw)
Stormbringer. The One Ring. The Monkey’s Paw. Sure,
that paranormal doohickey may possess amazing powers, but
it’s also a sack of miseries the likes of which few humans can
imagine. And you’ve got one. Lucky you…
As with the Background: Wonder (a Trait for which this
Flaw was once an adversarial Background), this Trait reflects
an uncanny item or device. In this case, however, the “treasure”
is more trouble than it’s worth. Perhaps it’s cursed with misfortunes, poorly made, haunted by malignant spirits, seething
with Paradox emanations, or too experimental for its own
good. It could be the earthly form of an unpleasant entity (“I
was a thousand times eviler than thou…”), an alien artifact, or the
remnant of a culture that passed into dust millennia ago – and
good riddance to them! Or maybe it’s simply a truly wondrous
treasure that dislikes you personally, like the Sword of Fighting
in JourneyQuest. For whatever the reason might be, you own
this mystic /hypertech millstone, and can’t easily get rid of it.
Like all variable-point Flaws, the value of this Trait depends
upon its ability to screw up your life. In this case, however, the
value of the Flaw is deducted from the Background cost of a
Wonder. In order to avoid nightmarish catastrophes of math,
every two points in the Flaw are worth one dot in the Wonder
Background’s cost. That cost, however, cannot drop below one
dot (two points), and so any points that get “left over” betweenChapter One: Heroic Traits 89
the value of the Flaw and the two points in that Wonder are
added to the owner’s character sheet, reflecting the proverbial
dead albatross around the character’s neck: a mighty burden
he can’t just toss away.
For expanded rules regarding Wonders, see the section of
that name in Chapter Two, pp. 139-165.
• (2 points) Your Jinxed item features an annoying
drawback that, while not deadly, makes life
difficult for the person who owns it. Examples:
it attracts ghosts, smells bad, makes irritating
sounds at inconvenient times, or radiates a
pervasive aura of discomfort.
•• (4 points) The Jinxed item has several annoying
drawbacks (as above), or perhaps one or two
problematic ones.Examples: It must shed blood
each time it’s employed, has a contentious
and unpleasant personality, attracts malignant
spirits, or tempts the owner to violate her moral
code.
••• (6 points) Your item features a host of annoying
drawbacks (at least six of them), three or four
problematic ones, and /or a major flaw. Examples: The item belongs a powerful paranormal
entity that wants it back, it inflicts constant
pain on whomever uses it (three bashing health
levels per turn of operation), the object radiates
an aura of corruption and decay, or it steadily
drives its owner toward atrocities.
•••• (8 points) In addition to at least six annoying
drawbacks and /or five problematic ones, plus
two or more major flaws, the item also backfires
if you fail a roll of Wits + Esoterica (or Wits
+ Hypertech, if the item employs advanced
technology), against difficulty 7. The Storyteller
is encouraged to get creative when deciding
how that backfire manifests; for suggestions,
see the Mucking About with Wonders chart,
Chapter Two, p. 141.
•••••• (10 points) In addition to the previous level of
difficulty, the Storyteller essentially has an open
license to make your life difficult in unexpected,
creative, and often mysterious ways. Examples:
A bloodthirsty cult that’s after the treasure, a
demonic entity imprisoned within the item, a
cross-dimensional vortex of probability fluxes
and quirks of physics that manifest in the
object’s vicinity, and so forth.
These flaws, of course, should be based in the nature of the
Jinxed item and its relationship to the owner. That said, there’s
no reason that a robot can’t be possessed by evil spirits or a
primeval artifact can’t be a technological hazard using unknown
technology. Stranger things, in Mage, happen all the time.
Permanent Paradox Flaw
(2, 4 or 6 pt. Flaw)
Following a nasty brush with Paradox, you’re got a Flaw
that just won’t go away. System-wise, select a trivial (two points),
minor (four points), or significant (six points) Paradox Flaw as
described on Mage 20, p. 551. That Flaw is now part of your
character’s life until you buy off this Flaw, preferably with experience earned through some extraordinary adventure that’s
related to the Paradox Flaw in question and the mishap that
created that Flaw in the first place.
Branded (3 to 5 pt. Flaw)
You’ve been found guilty by a Traditions Tribunal, who
Branded your Avatar with a sigil that indicates your crime. Folks
who can see that sigil recognize that you’re a criminal of some
sort, and the worse the Brand, the more severe your crime and
the more appropriate their reaction will be. Those reactions
won’t always be negative; considering the sort of people who’d
be favorably inclined toward a known criminal, though, do you
really want the goodwill of such people?
• (3 points) A temporary Brand for a Low Crime (see
below), which fades after one to three months. At the
end of that period, this Flaw goes away. This Brand raises
the difficulty of your social rolls by +1 for “average”
Tradition mages and +2 for especially law-biding ones.
• (4 points) A lasting Brand for a Low Crime. This Brand
lasts for a year or more, and marks you as a rather
notorious offender. The difficulty of your social rolls
rises by +2 among most mages who can recognize the
Brand’s significance, and +3 among mages who take
such offenses and punishments seriously.
• (5 points) A lasting Brand for a High Crime, which will
not fade for at least nine years and may be essentially
permanent. The Brand raises the difficulty of your social rolls by +3 for any character who cares at all about
Tradition justice and the people who incur its punishment. Certain parties will target you for additional
punishment, and others will consider you to be prime
meat for their recruiting efforts.
For details about Tradition crimes and punishments, see
Chapter Four’s entries regarding Crimes and Punishments in
the section Among the Traditions, pp. 213-219.
Demented Eidolon (3 pt. Flaw)
There’s someone in your head, and it’s not you. Despite
your commitment to logic and reason, a mad heretic rants
through the inside of your skull, insisting that what you do
is magick, not science. This rough voice drives you toward Superstitionism and Reality Deviance. Not that you would ever
consider such insanity. No, really – seriously, never.90 The Book of Secrets
A Flaw for Technocratic operatives and other technomancers who refuse to view what they do as “magic,” this
Trait pits your conscious-self against an Avatar hell-bent on
reclaiming the identity of mage. The Eidolon (Technocrat-ese
for Essence) invested within your Genius (Avatar) whips that
paragon of Enlightenment into Deviant directions. While most
Technocratic Geniuses behave themselves for the most part,
this one assumes a flagrantly supernatural mien and batters at
the fortress of Reason (and Social Processing) that protects you
from Deviant thoughts. It may even be entertaining to have a
different player assume the role of your Genius, especially during
a Seek… I mean, during one of those meditative interludes
which allow you to process the enigmas of Enlightenment.
Ideally, this Flaw compliments a Genius (Avatar) Trait rated
at 3 or higher, and it goes well (from a “dramatic roleplaying”
standpoint, anyway!) with Backgrounds likePast Lives,Destiny,
andLegend, Merits likeTwin SoulandAvatar Companion, and
Flaws like Throwback, and – as one may imagine – Dark Fate.
Haunted (3 pt. Flaw)
An angry ghost – perhaps even more than one of them – has
an entire skeleton to pick with you. Did you kill her yourself,
or does she blame you for her death? Did you commit some
awful crime against her during her living days, or were you
foolish enough to attempt (and perhaps succeed at) a bitter act
of necromancy against her after she had died? Whatever your
sin might be (and whether or not you actually did anything
wrong in the first place), this wraith is determined to make
you suffer for whatever remains of your own life… and possibly
your afterlife too, if she can manage that!
Check outWraith: The Oblivionto learn more about ghosts
and the various powers they can employ to harass the living. If
your group doesn’t include Wraith rules or characters in your
chronicle, your Storyteller can simply unload on you with the
many phantasmal abilities mentioned in haunting lore: rattling
chains, chilling voices, sudden drops in temperature, and so forth.
Primal Marks (3 pt. Flaw)
You’ve been marked by some god, spirit, myth, or other
metaphysical entity… and the mark is not a pleasant one.
Maybe you share Papa Ghede’s nasal voice and crude sense of
humor, or Coyote’s grotesquely huge cock, or Christ’s bleeding
stigmata. Essentially, this Flaw is the flipside of the Merit:
Mark of Favor; in your case, though, the mark complicates
your life, twists your body, and alerts people who understand
the significance of that mark. In certain circles – say, being
marked by Satan while living in a deeply religious region –
a Primal Mark can be a life-threatening affair. Such marks
can also indicate the profound displeasure of the entity in
question, like the Mark of Cain (in a non-vampiric sense,
anyway) which set the First Murderer apart while sparing his
life for a long-enduring punishment. But even if the entity in
question likes you, this particular mark is more of a burden
than a blessing. If, for instance, you stink like a goat and have
the heavy, hairy features of Pan, that’s not going to make
you terribly popular with the ladies… especially not if you’re
female to begin with!
This disconcerting legacy might come through as animalistic features that reveal your connection to a totem spirit, as
described in the Totem Background entry and the appropriate
section of Mage 20’s Appendix I. (See pp. 326-328 and 633-
636.) Or the “mark” might involve some physical manifestation
of your inner Avatar. You could share the archetypal “look” of
a notorious family, like the Borgias or Romanovs, even if you’re
not actually related to that bloodline; or bear an uncanny resemblance to some sinister beast even if you’re not a shapechanger
or totem-friend. Maybe you just look like what people think
of when they say wizard, shaman, or witch – which, in many
cultures, can be rather unhealthy for people so identified. In
short, you look weird in the literal, uncanny meaning of that
phrase, and people notice.
Obviously, you should define the appearance of this feature,
and decide the sort of reaction people have when they notice
it. Because this is a Flaw, of course, that reaction should be
negative in some way – the “primal mark of the Jolie-Pitt Clan”
is not exactly a Flaw unless you’re dealing with paparazzi. The
“mark” could also be a tone of voice, a distinct way of moving
(birdlike, catlike, Papa Legba-like), or a certain vibe that nearly
anyone can sense. Whatever their source and manifestation,
these Primal Marks are obvious, and they tend to carry over
even when a mage changes shape. People recognize you even
when you’d rather not be recognized, and that sort of distinction
can be rather unhealthy too.
This Flaw goes well with Backgrounds like Blessing,
Destiny, Legend, Past Lives, and, as suggested earlier, Totem.
It could be taken as a genetic Flaw for Enhancements, or as
a reflection of an especially potent Avatar. For extra fun, you
might not even know why you’ve been so marked, who marked
you, or what may come as a result of the mark. As with so
many elements of a mage’s life, these Primal Marks could be
mysteries whose answers lay at the end of a long and winding
Path… if, indeed, those answers ever reveal themselves at all.
Oathbreaker (4 pt. Flaw)
Sworn oaths are powerful things, especially when magick
is involved. And yet, you have broken your vow – not a simple
promise, but an oath of serious significance. “I’m sorry” won’t
cut it here; you need serious atonement in order to make
things right, and until that point, anyone who can read auras
or listen to gossip within the proper circles will know you for
the faithless swine you are.
A story-based Flaw, Oathbreaker marks your character out
as someone who is not to be trusted. People who place great
value in honor will shun her, and others will exploit what they
consider her generally dishonorable nature. Beyond that, other
characters may be hunting her, with the intention of exacting
penance or revenge… maybe both! Resonance, Paradox, Seekings, and Quiet will reflect the metaphysical dimensions of thisChapter One: Heroic Traits 91
broken vow. Your Seekings may involve literal guilt-trips in which
you’re confronted with the potential (or real) consequences of
your violated promise; your Resonance remains tainted by the
presence of dishonor; Paradox will assume appropriately ironic
forms, like visitations from the entity called Judgment in Mage
20, Appendix I; and should you fall into Quiet, there’ll be no
place to hide from the transgression you’ve committed. In short,
then, you’re screwed for reasons that are very likely your own fault.
(Tragic stories, of course, revolve around people who
broke vows without meaning to do so, or who were put into
no-win situations regarding promises that could not possibly
have been kept. The universe, however, can be implacable and
uncaring in such matters. “Fair,” among Awakened folk, is not
a common word!)
Some sort of penance should be available to an oath-breaking character. She might not know what that atonement is,
though, and the quest for such rectification could be the seed
for powerful stories (cf. the tragedy ofOedipus Rex). Atonement is
rarely a pleasant matter (again, see Oedipus), but the successful
performance of such rituals should erase this Flaw… at least
until you make and break another promise, that is.
For a related Flaw, see Faithless, below. To see potential
consequences of oath-breaking, check out the genre entry for
Tragedy in Chapter Five’s section Genre, Storytelling, and
Mage, pp. 285-286.
Prone to Quiet (4 to 5 pt. Flaw)
In an effort to avert the inevitable stresses of Awakened
life, you tend to drop into metaphysical Quiets (as per Mage
20, pp. 554-561) more easily than most other mages do. The
easier you fall into them, the more this Flaw is worth:
• (4 points) Quiet is your default Paradox backlash, and
so a backlash of five points or more automatically sends
you into Quiet.
• (5 points) Quiet is your default backlash, and you
can fall into it even without a Paradox discharge.
Roll your Intelligence + Enigmas dice pool when
you’re faced with an unusually stressful situation;
if you succeed, then you’re able to puzzle your way
out of the fall – and if not, well, then, welcome back
to Quietville… (The roll’s difficulty ranges from 6
to 10, depending upon the severity of the stress and
whether or not you’ve dealt with this particular kind
of stress before.)
Although it’s most often noticed in Virtual Adepts and
other Netizens, who tend to set off into the Digital Web in
order to escape physical unpleasantness, any mage can suffer
from this Flaw.92 The Book of Secrets
Beast Within (5 pt. Flaw)
You’ve got a truly infernal temper: one so violent it feels
like a volcano in your soul. As with a werewolf or vampire,
you’re subject to the dreaded frenzy that turns you into an
engine of hot rage. Under intense stress, you risk losing every
shred of enlightenment you possess. Driven to such extremity,
you let loose with the most immediately destructive powers at
your command, and “vulgarity” be damned! Everyone in your
vicinity becomes a target, and the consequences matter to you
only when this inner storm has passed.
System-wise, this Flaw sends you into deadly rages as per the
Berserker /Stress Atavism Trait featured in Mage 20, p. 644.
Instead of rolling your Willpower to avoid the frenzy, however,
you roll your Avatar rating plus one die, with your Willpower
as the difficulty of that roll. If, as an example, young Vyper
Trabia suffers from the Beast Within Flaw, with an Avatar of
4 and a Willpower of 5, Vyper’s player rolls five dice against a
difficulty of 5 when that Akashic hothead is under ferocious
stress. A failure on that roll sends Vyper into a berserk rage.
Yeah, this probably happens pretty often. Vyper’s friends don’t
stick around for long when things go poorly.
(If you employ the optional Resonance Trait described in
Chapter Two, you could substitute your highest Resonance,
plus one die, as the dice pool for your rage. The roll’s difficulty
is still your Willpower Trait, and your Resonance plus that extra
die should at least equal, if not exceed, your Avatar Trait. In
this case, the Resonance in question must be something capriciously unstable – Wild, Primal, Ferocious, and so forth – instead
of calm and centered energy. For details, see Four Flavors of
Resonance, pp. 136-138.)
Considering that the Avatar could be seen as your inner
Beast, a character with the Pattern Essence cannot take this
Flaw. It’s best suited for Dynamic Essences, although a Questing or Primordial Avatar could attain frightening rages too.
A berserk mage cannot employ rituals or employ complicated
tools; only the most direct methods of attack – magickal or
otherwise – will do. Although mages rarely suffer from such
grotesque lapses of self-control, an Awakened Ghoul (as in
that Merit), a cyborg, a Victor, a Shapechanger Kin (again, as
per the Merit), or an animalistic shape-changer could possess
such inhuman monstrousness.
For similarly bestial character traits, see the Mental Flaw:
Feral Mind (p. 52) and the Expanded Practice of Animalism
in Chapter Three, pp. 197-199.
Blood Magick (5 pt. Flaw)
Your Arts demand blood… specifically,your ownblood. And
while many practices employ small amounts of ritual cutting
or bloodletting, this degree of sacrifice demands an injurious
amount of vital fluid each time you cast a spell.
With this Flaw (mislabeled as a Merit in the sourcebook
Sorcerer, Revised Edition), you must suffer one unsoakable
health level in bashing damage whenever you employ an Effect. Story-wise, you cut yourself, slash designs in your skin, or
otherwise hurt yourself enough to shed the required amount
of blood. This sort of thing can, of course, add up quickly if
you’re throwing lots of magick around without giving yourself a
chance to heal, as bashing damage soon leads to lethal damage
(see Types of Injury in Mage 20, p. 406). Meanwhile, your
bloodletting looks pretty gross and obvious (often vulgarly
so), and tends to make a mess as well. Your companions might
appreciate the results of your magick, but may well object to
the methods you employ… especially since blood magick has a
rather unsavory rep among all but the most primal of practices.
Bound (5 pt. Flaw)
Mentor always told you not to make bargains with strange
entities. But did you listen?Nope. Now you’re in deep to someone
whose power dwarfs your own, and your prospects for getting
out of bondage are laughable at best. Haunted by thoughts of
the payment to come, you live on borrowed time and realize
that the worst is yet to come…
Sometimes known, with minor variations, as Faust’s
Bargain, Bound puts your character in the Faust-like position
of getting something interesting in return for something significant – her life, her soul, a thousand years of servitude, or a
similarly awful fate that no one in their right mind would want
to risk. Still, occultists are infamous for short-term thinking,
and literal devil’s deals are common currency in the magickal
world. The specifics of that deal are for you and your Storyteller to arrange; you might have received some Merit(s) and /
or Abilities in return for the debt (purchased with the points
from this Flaw), escaped an awful situation (“You want out of this
death-trap, dear wizard? Very well – what do you have to offer me?”),
saved someone who was important to you (“Sure, I’ll bring your
mother back from the brink of death – let us discuss the terms of this
favor…”), or otherwise blew a standoff with an Otherworldly
entity (see theSummoning, Binding, Bargaining, and Warding
section of How Do You DO That? pp. 91-95).
Like the Flaw: Dark Fate (below), this debt throws a foreboding air over your character’s part of the chronicle. In this
case, though, your doom may be averted if you can wrangle a
way out of this pact. In the meantime, your creditor will call
in occasional favors – nothing large enough to pay off the debt
(unless that entity needs a significant service and agrees to
write off the larger obligation), but deeds that can spark new
stories or complicate existing ones. Despite tradition, this debt
doesn’t have to be a soul-pact owed to a devil – a promise to
your god(s) or their immediate emissaries can be just as terrible
as one owed to Old Scratch!
Dark Fate (5 pt. Supernatural Flaw)
You’re screwed. No matter what you do, regardless of your
heroic deeds (possibly because of them), there’s a terrible end
in your not-too-distant future. Prophecies speak of it, visions
remind you of it, and other folks seem to know it too. You
realize this fact, and it weighs upon you. From time to time,Chapter One: Heroic Traits 93
you must spend a Willpower point in order to shrug aside the
dread of your impending damnation; otherwise, you lose one
die from all rolls for the rest of that day. A common Flaw for
Nephandi, Infernalists, and other folks who don’t know when
to stop fucking with Forces That Should Not Be Fuck’d With,
this Dark Fate becomes Damocles’ sword in your Storyteller’s
hands. Sleep well… while you can. (Once again, check out the
Chapter Five genre entry for Tragedy.)
Faithless (5 pt. Flaw)
Magick, according to your beliefs, does not come from
you – it comes from your god, and you’ve broken faith
with him. Until you can shake this crisis of faith, perhaps
atoning for your perceived misdeeds, your Spheres remain
stuck at Rank 1 – potent enough to perceive the presence
of Divinity around you, limited enough to remind you that
you have failed.
This Flaw (which is more likely to be “awarded” to you
through the course of the game than it is to be something
you purchased during character creation, though of course
you can start off a new character in such a crisis) represents
the power of faith in your character’s life – a power so strong
that it can interfere with your abilities as a mage. Ironically,
the strength of that faith denies you the ability to use magick
when you feel that your faith is lacking. From a game-system
standpoint, you are denying yourself the ability to access your
magick because you believe that your magick comes from a
source you have betrayed. Your mage believes that his god is
cutting him off from magick, though… and, considering that
the player is pretty much the “god” of a gaming character, in
a meta sort of way, that’s true.
Although a character with this Flaw can pursue any sort of spiritual focus, his paradigm and practicemustbe oriented toward religious
devotion. You could be a shaman or a priest, a Goddess-bound witch,
a spiritual scientist, even an Infernalist whose hell-spawned powers
flow from a damnation pact. Obviously, this Flaw means nothing
to an atheist, or to someone with nebulously casual beliefs. Only
a mage who believes deeply in some greater power can believe that
she has so much to lose from a sudden lack of faith.
In order to discard this Flaw, the player must pay a fivepoint “fine” in order to buy off the Trait itself, and roleplay
out a “dark night of the soul” sort of Seeking in which he
faces his sins and rededicates himself to his divine Path.
The character, meanwhile, must first undergo an atonement
that suits his belief system and the “sin” that invoked this
punishment. Maybe he needs to take strict vows within a religious order… or take on even stricter ones if he had already
broken his previous set of vows. Did he violate a taboo? Then
he must undergo ritual purification, often by way of fasting,
marathons of prayer, and some traditionally torturous ordeals.
A mage who has sworn never to kill, and yet who has killed
someone, may be forced to make significant restitutions to
the murdered person’s family. Traditional atonements include pilgrimages, vision quests, oaths of poverty, appalling
mortifications (self-torture, radical fasting, mutilation, and so
forth), and other difficult paths back to the favor of one’s god.
Regardless of the creed and specific atonements, however, the
mage must spend endless hours in intensive prayer. A faithless
soul, after all, must find his way back to the presence of his
god… typically on his knees.
Immortal Enemy (5 to 8 pt. Flaw)
Oh, dear. You’ve pissed off someone whose concept of
“eternal grudge” could be taken literally. Essentially, you’ve got
the Enemy Flaw with a powerful and more or less immortal
entity: a vampire elder, a demon, a demigod, totem spirit, Loa,
dragon, or other being who measures its existence in centuries
or millennia, with resources and abilities to match. Foolish
wizard, what will you do now?
For the relative power of this enemy (or perhaps for the
number of your enemies), see the Merit: Powerful Ally, p. 77.
Psychic Vampire (5 pt. Flaw)
Also known as the Reaper’s Touch, this dreadful curse
makes you a life-force siphon. Your presence consumes vitality
from your surroundings and the living things who happen to
get too close to you. Unless you do so, however, your own lifeforce withers. Despite your best intentions, you’re essentially
a walking void into which life itself pours in order to sustain
your own existence.
Story-wise, you’re a drain on the energy of your companions. Insects and small plants perish in your presence, while
children and animals smaller than a horse feel ill when you
stand near them. System-wise, any character who’s in physical
contact with you for an hour or more loses one health level per
hour to bashing damage. If you’re unable to soak up someone
else’s life-force, though, then your own vitality drains away. In
system terms, you lose health levels in the reverse order that
you would heal lethal damage, dropping to Bruised after one
day, to Hurt after three days, to Injured after one week, and
so on. (For details, see Mage 20, p. 406.)
If you employ Life Sphere magicks, your difficulties for
healing or improvement-type Effects are raised by +2, while
your difficulties with corrupting, damage, or illness-related
Effects are lowered by -2. (In both cases, the usual maximums
and minimums still apply.) Each health level you inflict on
someone else with Life Sphere magick heals you of one health
level if you’re injured, or else forestalls the “starvation” loss of
your own health levels by one day per health level inflicted.
An inversion of the Merit: Spark of Life (p. 78), this Flaw
darkens your aura, makes your blood taste awful as far as vampires
are concerned, and keeps your close associates constantly sick
with low-level ailments. Life-affirming mages consider this to
be a mark of profound misfortune or outright evil, while folks
who love corruption (Nephandi and the like) see you as a ripe
candidate for recruitment. Mundane science can’t do a damn
thing about this metaphysical malady, and dismisses such fluffy
concepts as “life-force energies.” The Technocratic Union, on the94 The Book of Secrets
other hand, takes this sort of thing seriously, and tends to view
psychic vampires as Reality Deviants of the most unfortunate kind.
For a potentially related metaphysical application of this
Flaw, see the Chapter Three Expanded Instruments entry
Cannibalism, pp. 206-207.
Bedeviled (6 pt. Flaw)
Oh, you poor bastard! A mysterious power has decided to
fuck with you, and it’s perfectly capable of making your life a
chronicle of woe. Misery and setbacks are your bread and butter;
should things start looking up for you, you begin looking up
as well to spot the inevitable anvil dropping toward your head.
This sort of thing goes way beyond simple misfortune or even
a paltry little curse. Your enigmatic foe is a dedicated cuss, and
whatever it might be (it’s not necessarily an actual devil, though
it certainly seems like one to you!), that force has apparently
unlimited resources and a very sick sense of humor; in short,
then, it’s your typical Storyteller.
A story-based Flaw, this wretched Trait essentially grants
the Storyteller a license to give your character the starring
role in a twenty-first-century Book of Job. (And again, check
out Tragedy.) There ought to be a certain rhyme and reason
behind this metaphysical fuckery, of course, but the source of
your agonies, and the way you could potentially end them, are
for your Storyteller to know and you to find out… should you
be fortunate enough to live so long.
Sphere Inept (6 pt. Flaw)
A particular element of Reality eludes you. No matter
how devoted you might be to mastering its complexities,
this field of magick remains a challenge. Essentially, this is
the reverse of the Merit: Sphere Natural, described above;
one Sphere costs 130% more (rounded up) to learn than the
other Spheres cost.
Rank Cost /Affinity Sphere Cost
New Sphere 13 pts
2 11 /9 pts.
3 21 /19 pts.
4 32 /28 pts.
5 42 /37 pts.
Again, this Flaw can apply to only one Sphere (fortunately!),
and comes through in your practice and backstory. Someone
who’s inept at understanding, say, Time will have a very wonky
relationship with schedules and timing.
Phylactery (7 pt. Flaw)
Your magick, perhaps your very soul, resides outside of your
physical self. Maybe you’ve placed your soul within a ring, a jar,
or a wooden doll in order to protect yourself from possession and
control. Or perhaps you believe that your wand, not your Will,Chapter One: Heroic Traits 95
is the source of your mystic powers. You could have built a robot
as an extension of your Genius, or crafted a jacket into which
you’ve instilled the very essence of who you are. The receptacle
itself is not important except with regards to its portability. This
Flaw reflects the fact that you must have the receptacle before you
can employ your Arts. Without it, you’re just another Sleeper.
Linguistically, phylactery comes from a Greek root meaning
“to guard.” In many forms of classical magick, practitioners
would place their souls or life-force within amulets, either as
protection for their souls or as portable vessels for spellwork.
Orthodox Jews sometimes employ tefillin – often referred to as
phylacteries – as reminders of their covenant with God. As a
Mage Trait, your Phylactery serves as a container for the “inner
god” that allows a mage to change reality: the Awakened Avatar.
How your character views this relationship between the
container, his Awakened self, and the ability to perform magick
depends on the character’s paradigm. A Slavic witch could believe
that she has taken her heart and placed it into a hardboiled egg;
a mad scientist may use consciousness-transposing co-location
theory in order to secure his brilliance in a vat-held brain. The
shapechanging shaman invests her soul into a wolf-skin, while
a Hermetic magus employs Roman rituals to lock his immortal
essence into a golden staff. Your phylactery is probably an item,
but it could conceivably be a location (a grove, a garden, a house,
etc.) or living being (a child, a bird, a tree, a manufactured intelligence housed within a mainframe, and so forth). The key is
this: Your mage must be able to physically access the phylactery in order
to employ Sphere magick. And therein lays the Flaw.
All told, a phylactery offers a few powerful benefits in exchange for some pretty significant drawbacks. On the plus side:
• A phylactery allows you to preserve a part of your consciousness outside your mortal body. That body may
be destroyed, but your soul and consciousness live on
until or unless the phylactery is destroyed. With Mind
4, you can project that consciousness into another body
or an astral form, while a character with Mind 5 /Spirit
5 can place your Awakened consciousness into a new
body for you.
• If the phylactery is taken from you, or you’re taken away
from it, you can retrieve it, or return to it, with a successful
application of the Correspondence Sphere. The difficulty
for this return Effect is 4 if the return would seem coincidental to a witness, 5 if it’s vulgar without witnesses, and 6
if it’s vulgar with witnesses. (Yes, the usual Paradox applies.)
• A living phylactery retains a psychic bond with you, as if
you’re in constant empathic and telepathic contact with
that character. (No roll necessary.) If the phylactery is a
place, then you retain an awareness of that place, and
can check in with it by using Perception + Awareness,
difficulty 6. (For very large areas, the check-in difficulty
may range from 7 to 10.)
• With the addition of the Merit: “Immortal” at the
seven-point level, your physical body may continue
to survive until the phylactery is destroyed… which, if
you don’t mind going without your magick for a while,
could render you more or less immune to death if
you then hide your phylactery away in a safe location.
Traditionally speaking, that’s why many mages make
phylacteries in the first place: to preserve their mortal
lives indefinitely.
• So long as your phylactery remains safe and undamaged,
you remain immune to Gilgul and other soul-trapping
attacks. Your body may be possessed, but your soul
cannot be stolen or destroyed unless someone attacks
your phylactery instead… in which case you’re screwed,
as described below. For details about Gilgul, see that
entry in Chapter Four, pp. 218-220.
• And if you invest your soul into a place, you literally carry
the essence of that place within yourself, while a part of
you always remains there. For practitioners of certain ancestral forms of magic (or simply for hardcore romantics),
that’s a very powerful reason to do such a thing.
Those are the good points. The downsides are as follows:
• If the phylactery gets destroyed, your ability to use magick
in this life gets destroyed along with it.
• You cannot perform magick or recharge your Avatar
unless you have some form of physical connection to
your phylactery. That form could involve a physical
gateway to virtual contact, as with a computer that
accesses a mainframe, but you still need that gateway
in order to reach a distant phylactery. (Yes, you may use
Correspondence Sphere magick to reach the phylactery,
and you are always counted as being one success away
from your phylactery when you use Correspondence to
reach out to it.)
• If your phylactery is a place, you must be in that place
in order to employ the Spheres. If it’s a living thing,
then that character has got to be within touching range
before you can use the Spheres. (Explains a lot about
Blofeld and his cat, doesn’t it?)
• If you’re using your phylactery to cast magick, you need
to be rather obvious about it – shouting commands to
your hypertech robot pal, holding your mystic crown aloft,
hewing your demonic sword through enemies as you shout
invocations to your patron god, that sort of thing.
• If your Avatar communicates to you through an embodied phylactery character, then you need to purchase the
Merit: Manifest Avatar (p. 71) to represent the Avatar’s
physical form.96 The Book of Secrets
• If your phylactery is an item, then it’s considered aunique
personalized instrument, as per the rules in Mage 20,
pp. 587-588. It can be broken, stolen or repaired, but
cannot be replaced if it’s totally destroyed.
Creating a phylactery of this sort demands high-level magick
– Correspondence 5 /Prime 5 /Spirit 5 /Mind 4 to be exact,
plus Matter 4 to invest one’s self into a material item, Life 5
to invest it into a living thing, and Life 5 /Matter 4 in order
to instill it into a place with an active biosphere – a forest or
lake, as opposed to a bare room or large metal box.
(A previous description of the phylactery investment ritual,
given in the sourcebook Dead Magic, p. 112, stated that only
Spirit 3 was necessary for investment; by the rules, however,
this claim is incorrect. You need Correspondence 5 to forge
so powerful a connection, Prime 5 to invest that intimate a
degree of vital energy, Spirit 5 to bind the Awakened Avatar
spirit into a separate place or being, and Mind 4 to project an
aspect of consciousness out of the body and into a separate
vessel. Spirit 3 alone does none of these things.)
Unless your mage is already a Master of the appropriate
Spheres, this Flaw assumes that some stronger power invested
(or trapped) your Avatar and consciousness into that phylactery
for you. According to some practices, a magical practitioner
must create a phylactery in order to use their most potent Arts;
although that’s not true in the greater scheme of Mage, that
doesn’t mean people don’t still believe that it is.
Taint of Corruption (7 pt. Flaw)
Evil has an intimate hold on you. Your spirit has been
corrupted – possibly since birth, as with the reborn Nephandi
known as widderslainte – and you are, as the werewolves put it,
“of the Wyrm” whether you wish to be or not. This doesn’t
necessarily mean you behave in an evil manner – you can
choose to resist the evil inside you. On a metaphysical level,
however, you bear an innate corruption which tests the ideal
of Enlightened self-determination. You may, perhaps, defeat
it, but it’ll be a hard struggle before you do.
(Need we mention the Tragedy section again? I guess we
just did.)
From a story perspective, this Flaw could come from demonic possession, the aftermath of an awful Quiet or a badly
botched high-level Seeking, corrupt Resonance, one too many
deals with malignant Umbrood, a curse, a vile past life, wicked
karma, Nephandic heritage, poor life-choices, the influence of
the Wyrm, a collection of tainted texts or artifacts, time spent in
a hell, or other forms of metaphysical poison. It almost certainly
shapes your magickal focus, and the things you do in pursuit
of your magicks (that is, your practices and instruments) may
well perpetrate this corruption. (Hey, now, hey now now…) To
entities who recognize such soul-stains, you are either a mortal
enemy (as far as most werewolves are concerned), an object of
pity and potential salvation (the nicer sorts of mages), or – most
likely – both. (“Hey, it’s a mercy killing, right?”)
Meanwhile, inside your skin, you wrestle with the urges
born from that corruption. Whether or not you give in to them
(which would, of course, just deepen the decay), your dreams
and impulses hold a distinctly unpleasant edge. Working malignant magick is frighteningly easy for you (-2 to your difficulties,
up to the usual modifier limits), but your “good” spells are
harder to cast (+2 difficulty, as above) and have a tendency to
leave traces of corruption even when you succeed. Your aura
crackles or swirls with leprous stains, and your Merits, Flaws,
Backgrounds, and other Traits reflect the damnation you carry
inside. A truly epic quest might purge this evil (and buy off
this Flaw), but maybe it’s just easier to go with the flow, even
if that flow leads you straight into the gutter and beyond
