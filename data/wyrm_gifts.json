The more deaths the victim has been responsible for, the more vivid and distracting the visions. Each day, the victim must make a Willpower roll at a difficulty set by the Storyteller to avoid losing a temporary point of Willpower. The difficulty ranges from 4 to 9, based on the amount of blood on the character's hands; an all-but-innocent who has done little more than set mousetraps and accidentally run over an opossum would be a 4, while the average Garou might resist at difficulty 7, and a murderous vampire at difficulty 9. The amount of remorse the character would ordinarily feel has no bearing on the curse; a vampire who cares nothing for the people he's drained to death will still be horribly distracted, as his victims appear far more real and far more frequently.
